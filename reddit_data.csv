As well as firing into the crowd with light assault rifle fire.\n\nIt is worth noting that the gunmen are not uniform in their dress, and are wearing civilian clothing.', ""Straight BS.

I notice just a little bit of difference, but mostly the same, but can you just take a moment to fathom that there might be people who have completely different values than you do. Black-and-white wrong and right up and down -- all different.\n\nWe have overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of adults in Gaza are pro-terrorist, and are quite happy to see Jewish women, raped, and all Jews murdered. That\'s what they love in life above all other things. They certainly love it more than their own children.\n\nThat doesn\'t make them less than human. In fact, it makes them very human.\n\nBut I would rather have Norwegians or Estonians as my neighbor, than Russians or Palestinians.\n\nWhat did the Palestinians want?\n\nWell, actually, I think what they want was summed in a speech almost 80 years ago. On October 7, they declared ""total war."" They didn\'t go in just to kill a few people. They just killed anybody that they met, from peace activists to young women to babies to anybody. In other words, they were doing something that was a European value in one country 80 years ago.\n\nShall we go back in time?\n\n""Ich frage euch: Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?!

In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific.

I sympathize heavily with Jewish people and their continual oppression over the last few millennium.\n\nAfter the 1947 UN backed partition plan of the British Mandate for Palestine, Arab Nations immediately declared war on Israel with the intend on seizing all of the newly formed Jewish State and the absolute rejection of the UN Partition Plan. One can argue that the lack of Arab consultation during the Partition Plan lead to its ultimate rejection among Arabs. Understand two things, firstly, the UK (which administered the Mandate for British Palestine prior to the 1947 Partition) was in a terrible economic and social condition from WW2 and thus eager to rid itself of the responsibility of administering what was rapidly turning into a warzone, and secondly Zionist movements were arguably more political organized and thus were able to advocate better for themselves at the UN, which are the time was mostly a European-dominated entity. These two aspects greatly reduced Arab, or non-jewish consultation during Partition Talks. I believe that this is one of reasons why Arab Nations, and the Arabs within partitioned Palestine/Israel decided to invade in 1947/1948. Again, the British had to decolonize their former holdings and just left, with all of their military (which were holding the peace) after the partition was finalized.\n\nThere are radical sects of both Arab/Palestine Nationalist groups and Zionist Nationalist groups. If you want a two state solution than these extremist/terrorist groups need to be dissolved or less the cycle of violence will just continue. These extremist political groups are the main barrier to a two state solution, there have been documented examples of extremist groups from both sides sabotaging peace talks. Radical sects like Hamas are the enemy of normalization, just as some far right zionist groups are. I have never seen this conflict as black and white, there are bad actors on both sides. \n\nYesterday was awful, truly awful. I fully expect the IDF to invade Gaza and systematically root out Hamas. I think it is warranted as Hamas is the elected political party in Gaza. I am not sure what Israel will do with the inhabitants of Gaza, there are 2 million people there. Maybe it will be administered similarly to how the West Bank is. I think this will lead to a walking back of normalization of relations between other Middle Eastern Countries and Israel. Depending on the US's involvement, this could lead to another 1973 energy crisis. Though I am not sure how likely that is, but it is possible. \n\nI think as time goes on, it becomes less and less likely of a two state solution. I think it is the best solution still. Hamas does not represent the collective Palestinian opinion, it is a fringe extremist group. I do think it is inevitable that Palestinians (especially in Gaza) will radicalize and the cycle will continue unless something changes.

From a prehistory as part of the critical Levantine corridor, which witnessed waves of early humans out of Africa, to the emergence of Natufian culture c. 10th millennium BCE, the region entered the Bronze Age c. 2,000 BCE with the development of Canaanite civilization, before being vassalized by Egypt in the Late Bronze Age. In the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were established, entities that were central to the origins of the Jewish and Samaritan peoples as well as the Abrahamic faith tradition.This has given rise to Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, Druzism, Baha'ism, and a variety of other religious movements. Throughout the course of human history, the Land of Israel has come under the sway or control of various polities, and as a result, it has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nIn the following centuries, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian Empires conquered the region. The Ptolemies and the Seleucids vied for control over the region during the Hellenistic period. However, with the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty, the local Jewish population maintained independence for a century before being incorporated into the Roman Republic.As a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, many Jews were killed, displaced or sold into slavery.Following the advent of Christianity, which was adopted by the Greco-Roman world under the influence of the Roman Empire, the region's demographics shifted towards newfound Christians, who replaced Jews as the majority of the population by the 4th century. However, shortly after Islam was consolidated across the Arabian Peninsula under Muhammad, Byzantine Christian rule over the Land of Israel was superseded by the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. From the 11th century to the 13th century, the Land of Israel became the centre for intermittent religious wars between Christian and Muslim armies as part of the Crusades. In the 13th century, the Land of Israel became subject to the Mongol invasions and conquests, though these were locally routed by the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule it remained until the 16th century. The Mamluks were eventually defeated by the Ottoman Empire, and the region became an Ottoman province until the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThe late 19th century saw the widespread consolidation of a Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism, as part of which aliyah (Jewish return to the Land of Israel from the diaspora) increased. During World War I, the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the Allies led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. The British government publicly committed itself to the creation of a Jewish homeland. Arab nationalism opposed this design, asserting Arab rights over the former Ottoman territories and seeking to prevent Jewish migration. As a result, Arab‚ÄìJewish tensions grew in the succeeding decades of British administration.\n\nIsrael was never Palestines in the first place.

The only way forward is practical progress.\n\nThis  role of this radical far right government led by Bibi, who has a  history of warmongering in order to secure his own power at home, simply  cannot be ignored in terms of its role to the build up of this attack. I  mean Bibi got exactly what he wanted from this attack, just like Bush  and his neocons with 9/11. Remember when Bush said ""you are either with  us or against us"" then 1+ million people died in Iraq and the decade  long ""war on terror"" that gave rise to ISIS and the re-emergence of the  Taliban and other groups and carnage and death and hatred? They also  used it to take away the freedom of Americans domestically. Bibi also  has a history of doing this, and this latest attack benefits him  personally the most:\n\n>The  protest group Kaplan Force announced the cancellation of its  demonstration against the judicial reform planned on 7 October in Tel  Aviv.

Forum 555 and Brothers in Arms,\\[126\\] a protest group of  reservist soldiers that organized boycotts of the military draft in  protest against the judicial reform, called on reservists to serve if  they were called up.\\[63\\]\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVPauUOVrmk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVPauUOVrmk)\n\nAll  Bibi has ever done is warmonger and create hate. He lied about Iraq  having WMDs and that led to a war that killed over 1 million. For the  past 2 decades, every month he has been claiming Iran is 2 months away  from a nuclear bomb. And when there was actually a nuclear deal that  brought some badly needed peace and stability to the region, and Iran  abided by, Bibi vehemently tried to crush it, and succeeded, and now  Iran went from around 5% enrichment to 84% enrichment as a result, 90%  is needed for the bomb. This is what being radical and unreasonable  does: it makes things worse, not better. Extremism begets extremism:  when you double down and leave no other option for the enemy, they will  fight back using whatever way they can, dirty or not. You can criticize  them morally but you can\'t stop them.

You can give moral value judgements as much as you want but it won\'t  practically stop these things from happening. Look how hard it is to  live in Canada, but we still have it much better than much of the world,  now imagine you are a kid in Gaza whose parents were killed by an  Israeli airstrike then you poor access to education and internet and  then you have nothing to lose and Hamas comes to recruit you and offers  you a goal in life and a sense of community. Regardless of value  judgements, practically, is this going to raise or lower the chances of  Hamas getting more recruits? Well factual historical evidence has shown  the answer to this. So you can sit here and condemn them all day, call  them terrorist, etc.. call for Gaza to get bombed even more, but this  will not change things, it will just prolong the cycle of violence.\n\nLook  at the latter half of the bottom quote, when you keep expanding your  settlements, keep acting radical and corner an animal with no way out  and with nothing to lose, you can blame it all you want but eventually  it will end up lashing out one way or another:\n\n>Andreas  Kluth, a former writer for The Economist, wrote in his Bloomberg News  column that Hamas ""torched Biden\'s deal to remake the Middle East"",  arguing that the deal that was being discussed between Saudi Arabia,  Israel and the United States would have left Palestinians in the cold,  so the group decided to ""blow the whole thing up."" He added that, viewed  from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that  Netanyahu\'s coalition partners, who opposed a two-state solution for the  conflict and would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank, even  at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state.\\[151\\]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October\\_2023\\_Gaza%E2%88%92Israel\\_conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2023_Gaza%E2%88%92Israel_conflict)\n\nAnd  now Bibi wants to continue what he always did: act radical, stubborn,  he will bomb Gaza to bits and kill 1000s of civilians, creating more  hatred for Israel and will cause an even more extremist organization  than Hamas to pop up in some years. This is actually how Hamas was  created in the first place: previous Palestinian militants were less  extreme. But years of Bibi\'s radicalism and continuous expanding of  illegal settlements (that even the USA criticized!) and mistreatment of  civilians in Gaza, restriction access to water, electricity, basic  infrastructure, policing their every movement with 1000s of checkpoints,  humiliation, suffering, etc..  ultimately pissed off and humiliated the  people in Gaza so much that they chose Hamas to represent them.\n\nIf  Israel is truly a democratic and civilized country they need to rise up  to the occasion and show this. The only way to break this cycle of  violence is to act rational and reasonable, and do things differently.  If they start treating people in Gaza with more respect and allow them  to improve infrastructure and living standards, and stop their radical push for unlimited illegal expansion of settlements, eventually extremists  like Hamas will lose support and there will be less hatred and more  peace. A civilized democratic country does not ""torture back"".. they say  we will not stoop to their level, we are better than this, and we will  abide by international law. Bottom line is, something has to give for  there to be change/to end this cycle of hatred and violence, and  unfortunately with far right radical power hungry leaders like Bibi this  cannot happen.', 'I fell Britain did not annexed others and played forty divisions !

Hamas has actively killed any political rivals such as Fatah as they are not Islamic enough. This is what the Taliban and Daesh do, kill any peaceful political Muslim rival parties and use Fascism to get into and maintain power under the guise of religion.

I will also provide examples of what the Prophet Muhammed(PBU) said about the treatment of non Muslims.\n\nThe actual meaning of this is ,   *I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying: ‚ÄòYou (i.e. Muslims) will fight against the Jews and you will gain victory over them. The stones will (betray them) saying: ‚ÄòO ‚ÄòAbdullah (i.e. slave of Allah)! There is a Jew hiding behind me; so kill him.‚Äô* [*1*](https://alsalafiyyah.github.io/hadith-on-stones-will-speak#fn:1) *This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari.*\n\nMuslim scholars state this is talking about a time when the-  ""*Jews are awaiting the false messiah (al-maseeh ad-dajjal or Anti Christ), for he is the one whom the Jews will follow. Seventy thousand of the Jews of Isfahan wearing tayalisah (a kind of head covering) will emerge with him. The Muslims will fight them with him, to the extent that trees and rocks will say: ‚ÄúO Muslim, here is a Jew behind me; come and kill him-  al-Jawab as-Saheeh li man baddala Deen al-Maseeh.""*\n\nSo when this happens the Jews are in a war with the Muslims,  and it says the Muslims will follow Isa(Jesus PBU) and will defeat the Jews and Dajjal (Anti Christ). Also this is a hadith, Its not in the Quran. Meaning when Jews fight the Muslims and the Muslims win, That means the end is near. It does not mean go out and kill the Jews, for no reason, and that will somehow bring on the hour ( ie day of judgment). \n\nOkay here are 2 examples from the same Hadith about treatment of non muslims (which include Jews)\n\nProphet Muhammed(PBU)  said the following:\n\n*‚ÄúWhoever kills a mu‚Äòahid (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, even though its fragrance may be detected from a distance of forty years.‚Äù Narrated by al-Bukhari* \n\n *"" whoever wrongs a mu‚Äòahid, detracts from his rights, burdens him with more work than he is able to do or takes something from him without his consent, I will plead for him (the mu‚Äòahid) ‚Äì or I will be the opponent of (the Muslim who wronged him) ‚Äì on the Day of Resurrection.‚Äù Narrated by al-Bukhari* \n\nIts funny how many Islamophobes cherry-pick and distort things, to fit their own Narratives. and how these two decrees of Prophet Muhammed(PBU) are never mentioned. Almost like there is an agenda to portrait Muslims as some sort of Global villains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving on, here is the problem with your N\\*zis (reddit keeps flagging me when I write the actual word, its ridiculous) equivalency to Palestinians (and Muslims as a whole). Muslims out there are not actively seeking out and killing  Jews, Unlike the N\\*azis, which may had some detractors, but still participated in. Totally false equivalencies. \n\nNa\\*zis were a party and they had a common goal, which included the eradication of Jews. That\'s why you can generalize. They weren\'t a religion.

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nb3trt/both_sides_are_being_mislead_of_the_full_truth/,Both sides are being mislead of the full truth,"So this is my compilation of how this whole thing started, after a lot of research from both sides, since each was holding back information and using it to instigate hate towards the opposite group

So first the prime minister was facing elections and most of the people who would vote for him are Jews, he wanted to get on their good side so he broke peace treaties that allowed housing of Palestinians in Jerusalem after the war took away their property and they had nowhere to live 

Extremist Jews jumped on the opportunity because they believe that Israel is theirs and needs to be populated by only Jews, and for years they have been settling places on the borders of the country to try and claim ""there are too many Jews here for it not to be considered our land and we outnumber Arabs so they should be kicked out"" 

It caused a court case that lasted a while, both sides providing proof that it is their property from many years ago, and it was supposed to continue and be held on Jerusalem day 

That same week happened to be also Ramadan which is a holy time for Muslims and they may or may not be agitated at this time of the year, also because Jews celebrate them being kicked out of their land years ago and they started a riot in the Al Aqsa mosque

At that time it was under renovations and there were rocks lying around, it is unknown where they got fireworks and liquid fuel, maybe to celebrate Ramadan? But people assumed they organized it all 

The crowd was riled up partially by the housing situation, because it meant something deeper about them not feeling safe to live anywhere and that their documents that show it's their housing is suddenly meaningless and is being taken away as if they don't matter at all, just because of some racist people

The crowd started throwing rocks as they got riled up, at the police and some over the wall, trying to target Jews on the other side too? 
The police tried calming everyone down, didn't allow access to the Jews into the wall area, while trying to disarm the situation multiple times before needing to resort to more extreme measures 

They used rubber bullets and tear grenades to subdue the people to keep everyone from attacking each other 
The crowd that was throwing stones and fireworks at the police scattered in fear and some ran into the Al Aqsa mosque

People were praying at the mosque at the time and didn't know what was going on, especially because it was a holy time for them

The ones throwing rocks kept throwing them at the police from inside the mosque, and as the police was trying to continue to calm down the situation, the people praying were told that the police was trying to take over the mosque and were hiding in fear in it, some retaliating, and as the police didn't know who was who they used means that won't permeantly damage to contain the situation, such as using tear grenades

The following morning was Jerusalem day and the parade that usually takes occur on this day to represent the victory of Jews winning the war over the Arabs wasn't cancelled, and instead was held with enthusiasm, which riled up the Arabs even more given the circumstances.

Chamas then started shooting rockets at Israel at random, most of them were disarms by the iron dome, but it didn't get them all, and there were a few casualties. 

Also the Arabs riled in the streets, throwing rocks at cars and trying to forcefully beat up people in their car and pull them out, the car driver panicked and accidentally ran into a person on the sidewalk, but he was ok as he stood up, the agression was extreme and luckily the police arrived shortly after to disarm the situation

By this point, the Israeli defense force was taking measures to destroy the locations in which the rocket were shot from which the terrorists decided should be public civilian places such as schools and mosqes and hospitals, there by in order to disarm them there were casualties in lives of citizens and children 22 adults, 9 of which were children

The chamas kept retaliating and shooting about 200 more missiles at Israel in random, some actually hit places like tel Aviv and caused major damages and and injuries and some deaths in total 

Because the defences of Israel against rockets are great, there were less casualties on the Israeli side of the conflict, as they tried disarming the Palestinian sources of the missiles, and because they chose places that are public, innocent civilian suffered the consequences. 

And that spread all over the news outside of Israel and people were mad because they thought we knew there were children in there and we killed them anyway, but from the information we had, some terrorist leaders were in there, and because it's so difficult to know where they are they chose to act fast, people believe that netanyahu is in support of this due to his bias against Palestinians

This is documented from observing both sides of the story as of 12:30 pm may 12 2021, both sides didn't give all the information that occured and after some research this made more sense. There may be new information after this documented time period which isn't included.

I would like people to know the truth, I hate that hate is being spread by people with motives towards the opposing groups and it's costing lives on both sides just because of a spread if misinformation.",1324,nb3trt,645,[],1620865669.0

I‚Äôve received the most nightmarish scenario :

my best friend was in a nature party when they heard the missile alarms, they ran to their cars to flee and terrorists waited for them on the highway, it was a trap. 
A friend was in the vehicle with him, he said they got to the car and tried to flee, saw dozens of bodies lying in the floor, they went past a burnt car when a terrorist started spraying at them. The driver friend got shot in the arm, my best friend got shot in the head and begged for help that didn‚Äôt come in time, the friend who survived tried to resuscitate him to no avail, he suffered for three hours barely conscious begging to be saved until he died. The army eventually came and evacuated the driver friend. He now has to live with his best friend dying in his arms whilst tripping on psychedelics, being unable to help.
Fuck Hamas. To all those saying shoot them in the head, Fuck that. Torture them for years before they get the release of death.

I was an israeli soldier , armored corps, and few days ago..I just found out that a kibutz I was entrusted with protecting for 1.5 years ( kibutz is kind of a village) been slaughtered, you know the story .
I cant bring myself to sleep, to stop crying, I feel just...lost, they were not part of any war , they were just people living their life .

So I see people standing with Gaza , let me set things straight.
You don't stand with Gaza, you stand with Hammas , they dont just slaughter my people, they slaughter their own , they are playing with lives for the sake of publicity , forcing people to stay in their homes after we told them to evacuate , so they could show atrocities all over the news, they force families to stay and die brutally in their homes .

And then I see LGBTQ standing with them...and thats i gotta say, just crazy.
I mean , CRAZY, if those people were to visit Gaza they would be slaughtered and their bodies would hang over the city walls as a reminder of what happens to people who thinks to be openly gay .

We are facing evil , evil that isnt scared to die, isnt scared that his people will die, it only wants one thing..that we suffer, even if they have nothing at the end, and there is no one , they just want to kill.
Every money israel ever gave them to actually build their city and care for their people, they took to fund bombs and weapons , and I am not just standing against them as an Israeli, I stand against them as a human , because this thing right here is the kind of s**t that will annihilate human race .

They got in this country, and they took an israeli Muslim male nurse, they heard him praying for his life in arabic, and they shot him in his chest nonetheless, cuff him and started running with him , he survived , he told the news that he recalled them saying in arabic "" good , now we have israeli hostage, they wont attack us from the air now"".

We fight them as humans , no muslim, no jew, no christian, left , right , straight , gay .

Only Humans .

Its original purpose was to defend Jewish settlements, from the Liberation movement of Arabs who were living in what was then Mandate Palestine.\n\nDespite being an armed force, restraint was a strategic policy used by the Haganah members with regard to their activities, and they weren\'t really that radical.\n\nThis Changed When The British Government issued the [White paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\\_Paper\\_of\\_1939), which severely slowed down Jewish settlement in Palestine.\n\nAs a Reaction, Haganah Turned to bombing and sabotage (In 1940 a Haganah bomb sunk the ocean liner SS Patria, killing 267 people).\n\n\nAfter Israel declared its independence, Haganah was dissolved and basically became the core of the IDF.\n\n\nBut going a few steps back, Haganah\'s restraint policy was objected to by the most radical and extremist members because it appeared defeatist to them. These radicals split off and formed the group Irgun, and from this one split off another group Called Lehi.\n\n\nIrgun with a symbol of [hand holding a rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irgun.png), believed that force is the only way to liberate the homeland. And was best known for The bombing of The King David Hotel (91 Killed).\n\nIrgun was described as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, British and American governments.\n\nLehi\'s declared aim was to build a ""new totalitarian Hebrew republic"". They were extreme right-wing in their views and soaked in racism, their publications often described Jews as a ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù. Lehi was Best know for the assassination of Lord Moyn, as well as the UN Swedish mediator Folke Bernadotte.\n\nLehi referred to its members as terrorists and admitted to have carried out terrorist attacks.\n\nAnd Both of them carried out the [massacre of Dier Yassin]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir\\_Yassin\\_massacre) (107 Killed).\n\n\nAfter the creation of Israel, the IDF was created, merging Haganah, Irgun, Lehi under one wing.\n\n\nSo What has some paramilitary groups to do with Netanyahu‚Äôs party?\n\nWell, The former members of Irgun went on to form Herut, a Far-Right party (became Right-Wing afterward) that took part in Israel‚Äôs first election, The party was headed by Menachem Begin, an Ex-member of Haganah and former Commander of Irgun.\n\n\nWorth mentioning That after the creation of Herut an [open letter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New\\_Palestine\\_Party;\\_Visit\\_of\\_Menachen\\_Begin\\_and\\_Aims\\_of\\_Political\\_Movement\\_Discussed) signed by a number of prominent Jewish Intellectuals, (Including Albert Einstein) condemned Herut as ""akin to Nazi and fascist parties"", and as a ""terrorist party"".\n\nAnd its Leader was noted as ""leader of the notorious terrorist organisation"" by the British government and [banned](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5025439?v=1621559450796) from entering the United Kingdom.\n\n\nAfter years of being active on the political floor, in 1973 Herut merged with other parties to form the Likud party, a name that you may already have heard of.\n\nBy 1977 they had grown in influence to win the election, And Menachem Begin came First.\n\nYes, the ‚Äúleader of the notorious terrorist organization‚Äù Irgun, who had ruled the denounced ""terrorist, fascist"" party Herut, became Prime Minister of Israel.\n\nMenachem was regarded as The Godfather Of [Israeli settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\\_settlement) in the West-Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\n\nSurprisingly in 1980 (during his rule time), the Israeli government gave amnesty to all Lehdi Members. And rewarded them with Lehdi Ribbon as recognition of their efforts to establish Israel. So literally they were forgiving and rewarding themselves for the crimes and terrorism they commit, meanwhile denouncing as ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù every group trying to get back Palestine.\n\n\nDue to health conditions, Menachem was forced to step aside and hand over the reins to a comrade-in-arms Yitzhak Shamir, Who was a former Irgun member, until he had moved to Lehi to become its leader.\n\nSo the leadership of Israel was switched from the hand of a former terrorist to another former terrorist.\n\nYitzhak ended up serving for 7 years to become the third longest-serving prime minister in the history of Israel.\n\n\nLikud lost power to The labor party represented by Yitzhak Rabin (a former member of Haganah) but not for so long, a new challenger from the Likud party led a great effort to take the power again. By accusing Rabin‚Äôs government of being ""removed from Jewish tradition‚Äù, because of Olso‚Äôs peace accord that had been made between Palestinians and Israelis. The new challenger led a mock funeral procession featuring a coffin and hangman\'s noose at an anti-Rabin rally where protesters chanted, ""Death to Rabin"".\n\nRallies organized by Likud and other right-wing groups as objections to the Oslo accord.\n\nAnd on the 4th of November 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing extremist Yagil Amir, Short after that, the chair was free for Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu lost power in 1999 and stepped aside from the political screen for a while, get back to the chair in 2009, and held it ever since to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel while leading a party that was born from terrorist roots.\n\nThis extremism and terrorism aspect in the Likud‚Äôs idealogy, and in the idealogy of its former leader (former terrorist with ‚ÄúFascism‚Äù and xenophobia) explains why the government has been acting in this way. The IDF was made by a conjunction of these terrorist groups, that\'s why we see this inherited violence and brutality in them.\n\nThe first election was in 1949 from that time till now (75 years) almost half of it (35 years) was under the control of the Likud.

But (a) each group owned about the same amount of land and (b) neither group had a state.\n\nThe UN partition plan divided the land into two states of about the same size (the Jewish state though was disproportionately barren desert in the Negev.) the plan was adopted  by a vote of  33-13 with 10 abstentions in the UN General Assembly. But the Arab world rejected the agreement. They attacked the Jewish state and were defeated but occupied the remaining parts of the Arab state (Egypt occupied Gaza and Jordan occupied the West Bank). So an Arab Palestinian state was never created. There was never anything to shrink down.\n\nThe first and only time the Palestinians had any autonomous control of their own territory was after they signed the Oslo peace accords in 1993 and gained autonomous control over parts of the West Bank. The Palestinians gained control over the land of Gaza in 2005 when Israel unilaterally withdrew.

Both Muslim and Hewish populations hated British colonial control.  After WW2, the Allied nations decided to pull the British out of the area, giving land to both Muslims and Jews, and providing a place for displaced European Jews to call home.  Arabs rejected the two-state solution, and Israel was attacked by every neighboring country.  This was intended to finish off the Jews for good, but Israel won and survived.

In fact, there are still massive numbers of Palestinian refugees and their descendants still living in refugee camps in the surrounding nations, denied citizenship and freedoms by those nations. \n\nSo, back to the one major fear of the Jewish people - their own government could betray them as they saw happen in Germany, Austria, Russia, etc. The Islamic population of Israel and Palestine combined would outnumber the Jewish population, so if Israel gave the Islamic population equal rights, the guarantee of a Jewish government would be lost. Also consider that the Muslim population of the Middle East has sought to violently expel the Jews from the area even before the founding of modern Israel, and continues to do so now (Hamas\'s own founding charter calls for the obliteration of Israel), and you have a nation that has been effectively at war for its own survival for over 70 years. \n\nAs an aside, it\'s also worthwhile to note that the blockade that makes the Gaza Strip an open- air prison, as some would call it,  is a cooperative effort between Israel and Egypt. So Egypt, the nation that once ruled the Gaza Strip and shares numerous cultural ties with it, is also preventing movement across the border. \n\nFatah, the governing political party in the West Bank and the UN- recognized government for both the West Bank and Gaza, is unable to work with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nSo you have a bordering Islamic nation participating in limiting Gaza\'s ability to operate and the recognized Palestinian government unable to work in Gaza, all due to the extreme nature of the Hamas government.', ""Calling Israel an Apartheid State, is propaganda, here are facts.

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1749ufc/as_a_palestinianamerican_i_am_disturbed_on_many/,As a Palestinian-American I am disturbed on many levels,"As background, I am a Palestinian-American born and raised in the US. I am pro-Palestinian and consider myself fairly well-read and pragmatic on the conflict. In following for the past two decades since my teens, this is perhaps the most disturbed I've felt and I think it has to do with the scale. A few points:

1) Hamas committed a terrible tragedy. This was a massacre of civilians. I feel for the Israelis who lost loved ones and others held captive. Seeing the body count of Israeli civilians climbing was like a continuing punch in the gut. I always knew Hamas was ruthless, and did not see them capable of caring this out on such a horrendous scale.

2) For every Israeli civilian killed, I know there will be 10 civilians in Gaza killed by the end of this. Israel has no choice but to respond in great force. This will be on the largest scale Gaza has ever seen. The sinking feeling of seeing the Israeli civilian deaths is now paired with the anxiety of the coming destruction in Gaza.

3) I knew there were no prospects going forward in the conflict. This will just further cement things. The far-right on both sides will be strengthened. This is a gift for Netanyahu who will stay in power. Hamas know Israel will respond in great force, and doesn't care because it furthers their cause of blaming Israel. Both sides are abhorrent.

4) Moderates on both sides will be pushed to the right by the end of this. Israelis are rightfully horrified about the massacre and murder committed by Hamas but will blame the Palestinians as a whole for complacency/support of Hamas. Palestinians continue to be brutalized by the occupation and will become increasingly desperate and resentful of Israelis, especially in Gaza. I see the occupation only getting worse going forward.

5) The next generation of Palestinians will be just as resentful and more prone to Hamas-like propaganda blaming Israel for everything. Whatever happens will die down eventually and just repeatedly boil over into rounds of violence.

6) Regarding the current dialogue: I am frustrated by those who are uninformed about the conflict blaming Palestinians/Muslims for everything with really no understanding of the last 50 years of occupation. I am also equally frustrated with the Arabic/Muslim community in my circles that in my opinion have not been strong enough in condemning the violence against Israel.

Pragmatism and concessons are dirty words in today‚Äôs day and age, but it Is what we must push for. \n\nI applaud your courage in writing what you did. It is hard to disagree with your friends and family. I think that Israel shutting down Gaza‚Äôs water and food is wrong. \n\nIt is hard to even say something because of how painful it all is. It is easier to live life and forget this and in fact, a part of me thinks that‚Äôs a good idea. It‚Äôs just tragedy on top of tragedy on top of tragedy and you know what they say: ‚Äúlaugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone.‚Äù', ""When looking at the massacre this week, it's important to remember that Israelis has seen that many times from Hamas before. Killing people in night clubs, blowing up civilian busses, shopping malls, and so on used to be Hamas default way of action in the 90s, before Israel closed the borders. Back in the 90s, Gaza used to export fruits, vegetables to Israel, people in Israel used to go eat in restaurants in Gaza/West Bank (same way Israelis go today to Israeli-Palestinian places, and work with Israeli-Palestinian). \n\nUnfortunately, Hamas started doing similar acts of terrorism (See Maxim Restaurant, https://youtu.be/KoHRwlHEHbQ, Dolphinarium Massacre https://youtu.be/wlQKMOvmaLc, and many others https://www.gov.il/en/Departments/General/suicide-and-other-bombing-attacks-since-the-declaration-of-principles), so Israel's response was to close the border, and later (2005) completely disconnect from Gaza and let Gazans rule Gaza. \n\nUnfortunately, instead of creating a prosperous city state, this caused a civil war in Gaza (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)) causing at least 118 Palestinians to be killed by other Palestinians. The Hamas won. And stayed in power to this day.\n\nThis caused both Israel and Egypt to stop cooperating with Gaza, which in turn made the economic situation in Gaza worse. With Hamas leaders getting net worths of billions of $ (Ismail Haniyeh's net worth is over $4 billion, and other Palestinian leaders are not far behind https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-the-phenomenal-wealth-of-hamas-leaders-1000957953, or search on Tiktok/X #GazaYouDontSee).\n\nWhile the media tries to separate Hamas from Gazans, unfortunately Hamas couldn't operate if not for the support of civilians. And they get civilian support by starving and leaving them without work, by diverting donations, inventing employees and pocketing their salaries, by withdrawing supplies and creating deficiency, and blaming it on Israel, while buying luxury cars and building mansions in Gaza, Qatar and Egypt.\n\nSo while Saturday's massacre of civilians is devastating, it's actually nothing new from Gazan and Hamas. The only thing that changed, is that unfortunately, when Hamas was doing those atrocities in the past, there was no social media and camera phones to record it. And the news are easy to be bought. By the time social media appeared, Israel blocked Gaza, disengaged, made harsher security protocol and built Iron dome. So the number of casualties in Israel went down, while in Gaza went up. Until Saturday, that is. We're back in 2001, with Hamas killing civilians in parties, restaurants and night clubs, but this time there is social media to document it."", 'The things I‚Äôve seen people say in completely unrelated subs who were clearly never familiar with or cared about the Israel - Palestinian conflict until this week have completely disturbed me. I have lost so much faith in humanity in the last few days  - not only from the tragedies that have occurred but from peoples really disgusting reactions to it.', 'You are right. Unfortunately that is a likely continuation of this sad story. Or...this could also be an opportunity to try to free Gaza from the Hamas and make it a country in which money to reconstruct and provide education would be provided. On the other hand Netanyahu needs to be taken down. He is an extremist too. Israeli people and Palestinian people should unite in the fight of their own extremists. Your view is unfortunately more realistic than mine I am afraid. It is sad really. Both parties could really benefit from a long and lasting peace. May someone hear me.', ""This is the single most devastating event for the palestinian cause.\n\nIf until now the Palestinians hated the israelis (how much? You tell me) and Israelis hated the palestinians but wanted to appease Hamas for quiet, now that turned to blind hate, the israelis will never negotiate with gaza again, will never let them work in israel again, will never provide them with electricity, water and commodities again and will bomb them again at the slightest provocation.\n\nThere is no chance for a non violent solution (I'm not even bothering to write the word peace) and the two state solution is dead."", ""Israeli here. \nI just wanted to say I really appreciate you for making this post. Other than your point about Netanyahu staying in power, which I believe you're wrong about because people are furious with him, I agree with everything you said. \nHonestly, seeing all the violence and hatred that's been going on this past month is gut-wrenching, so finding someone rational like yourself is a breath of fresh air. \nThank you.\nI doubt it will happen in our lifetime, but I truly hope one day my people and yours will finally be able to live together in peace."", '[deleted]', 'I dont think this is a point in favor of Netanyahu, his followers always view him as a leader in terms of securing and defending Israel, and this is a colossal failure and loss his government is accused of from the israeli public eye. I hope this means he can finally be replaced', ""Hi OP, Jewish-American here. just want to give my two cents on item 4 and 6:I haven't been moderate on the issue in a long time. With each successive violent eruption, I'm actually pushed a little farther to the left. I've always considered myself a Zionist because I identify with the classical definition written by Leon Pinsker in reaction to Jews being slaughtered in the Russian Empire. My definition of Zionism has never included death, oppression, and occupation. We can't give up. Palestinian liberation will ensure the future of Jewish liberation. We *cannot* allow the extremists and ideologues without a personal stake in the matter to pull us apart when I know the vast majority of us want peace, safety, and dignity for all.\n\nThat said, I am so appreciative that you acknowledge the difficulty within your own community. We're grieving so deeply for our dead right now. Both communities are so familiar with that pain, but continue to hurt each other. I'm tired of both of our communities being played against each other and objectified by people who are hardly versed in the history at all. I'm mourning for Israel. I'm mourning for Gaza. I hope this is a massive wakeup call to broad coalition.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo"", '""...committed by Hamas but will blame the Palestinians as a whole"" no, I know that Gaza is really occupied by Hamas. The brainwashing of kids, glorifying violence has to stop, that is all that will break the cycle. It is that education which you saw playing out in Israel ending with babies being beheaded.

This is not another tit for tat flare up followed by a cease fire and a return to the status quo. Hamas‚Äôs control over Gaza is no longer acceptable. This will be the last war in Gaza.

And many don‚Äôt. Some are skeptical of what those numbers are of course. \n\nWe also know and recognize many innocent gazans will die. \n\nBut what Hamas has done. And the existential threat it now poses- has pushed just about every Israeli and Israeli supporter to put aside their feelings for the innocent and focus on their own. \n\nWishing you only the best. May one day we be able to dance together', 'Israelis especially those who lost family or have family held hostage are blaming Netanyahu. He might be in power while they‚Äôre at war but I think they will see that his idea of defense backfired.', 'Really well said.', 'I think this is very well said. \n\nI also think that while this was not something you thought Hamas capable of, it was always evident and is inline with their stated goals. It is important to remember that while Palestinians are rightly driven by their experience and the occupation, Israel‚Äôs actions are also driven by the known threat that Hamas makes and will act upon given the smallest wiggle room. I do not know what Israel should do or have done. I am sure that any proposal of what they could have done differently could just have easily also ended poorly for multiple peoples. \n\nI am also not sure how this current fighting will end. You seem to implicitly think that this will end with a bombing and go back to the old status quo. I do not think that will happen. When things like this have happened in the past, Israel has usually increased security measures, building protective walls and checkpoints and increasing occupation forces. They will do this for their own safety to prevent the same thing from happening again. This will almost certainly be a tragedy for the people of Gaza who will be impacted.

So to say occupation ,or their land is just a joke. We have tried to co exist, they had every opportunity to do that . But every time they‚Äôve choose to annihilate us. And it happens in 1948 with 6 countries against us and after a year plus of fighting we‚Äôve gain control of what is bigger portion of the so called 2 state solution. And it continued to a war in 56‚Äô,67‚Äô (six day war) 73‚Äô yom kipor , 82 Lebanon war , first intifada  90‚Äôs and the list goes on. Any country that fought for their land  , and that went to war and lost . knew that losing meant , also losing their land in the process and just look at the history books in so called Europe and how many countries at some point all ruled over majority of Europe . From Italians , French , Germans , English and the list goes on and on. Israel was among the few who actually wanted peace and after conquering Sinai ,which is almost same size of Israel . offered it back in exchange for peace!!  and we‚Äôve made the same efforts afterwards. Now mind you this we are not only the wining side, but also strategically more stronger .but we just don‚Äôt want to keep fighting and live like that. We didn‚Äôt have the USA support then.

Every country in our generation would not only go to war against them , but will put an end to that threat! When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and killed 2k plus people , the USA retaliated in what known one of the biggest acts of war to ever recorded. that sent a message to the whole wide world not to mess with the USA or even try. When war is Syria took place within its own people and over 250k people are dying no one makes such a big deal out of it .and I‚Äôve seen kids getting slaughtered while most of you stayed quite while the most purest things have been murdered.

It was born on false promises and foreign intervention. It was not created out of peace and consideration. \n\nIt all started back in WWI when the British conquered Palestine and made two conflicting promises to the Arabs and Jewish Nationalist. At the time of the promise to Arabs in 1917 (through a series of letter correspondence with the Arab leader) there were approximately 800,000 Arabs compared to only approximately 94,000 Jews in the country. When the Brits promised an independent state to the Arabs following the war the Arabs started a civil war/uprising in the Ottoman Empire (the Arab Revolt). Then in 1918 the Brits drafted the Balfour Declaration which promised a homeland to the Jewish people in Palestine. \n\nThen after the end of the war, Britain was given a Mandate for Palestine in 1920 on behalf of the Palestinians and one for the international society which incorporated the Balfour Declaration. This meant that the Brits had to support both Arabs and Jews.\n\nDuring the mandate period two different societies popped up - one for Arabs and one for the Jews. They had separate economic and societal structures and were completely independent from each other. \n\nIn the Jewish society the Zionist movement gained a stronghold on all policies and intentions. Their mission was two fold - acquisition of land and immigration. Zionist and foreign financial institutions started to purchase large tracts of land from Arabs, as they had way more capital than the Arabs and were bolstered by outside foreign investment. During the period of 1917-1948, the population grew to have 1.5 million with natural growth from the Arabs and Jewish immigration - with the Jewish population outpacing the Arab by growing over 10 fold.\n\nDuring the period between 1918 and 1940‚Äôs the British pushed hard for Jewish immigration into the region. Arabs called for a stop or a slow down to British supported Jewish immigration because they saw the writing on the wall. The British failed to head to these demands and continued to push the effort forward.\n\nBoth the Jewish Nationalist and Arabs knew that British mandate would end and that meant whoever had the biggest population and most amount of land would gain control of the country. The Jewish nationalists had so much more leverage in terms of capital and resources compared to the Arabs that the Arabs couldn‚Äôt keep up with the growth or economic strategies. The Arabs, who had lived there since 700 AD (compared to some academic takes that they‚Äôre the native people of the land), saw their homeland being swallowed by non-native Jews that were bolstered by foreign powers, and knew that if they didn‚Äôt rise up against these efforts they would be displaced.\n\nFighting broke out frequently between the two groups throughout the 1920-30s - costing hundreds of lives. The events of 1929, known as the Wailing Wall Riots, was a turning point in the history of the British Palestinian Mandate where Arabs stopped separating out Jewish-Arabs from non-native Jews and the Jews finalized their thoughts on Zionism and that a home nation was required - without Arabs.\n\nThese riots made Britain set up an investigation into the conflict - the Shaw Commission - which led them to changing their support for Jewish immigration and land purchasing (a lil‚Äô too late if you ask me!).', ""No, they don't - Israel calls it disputed, they don't like the term occupied.

The Brits responded with a heavy hand and squashed the revolts resulting in the deaths of between 2-5,000 Arabs.\n\nBecause of the revolts the Brits issued what is called the White Paper in 1939 which called for an Arab majority control of the region in 10 years but was rejected by the Arabs and horrified the Jewish nationalist. The Arabs didn‚Äôt trust the British and the Jewish Nationalist were appalled at the White Paper‚Äôs call to limit Jewish immigration and acquisition of land.\n\nIn response to the White Paper, the continued limitation of immigration and land acquisition, between 1944-48 underground Jewish Nationalist started to attack British troops and holdings. At the end of WWII in 1945, this group saw that the British had no intention of establishing a Jewish homeland, as restricted immigration and land acquisition continued, decided to ramp up attacks until they were able to capture Jaffa where the state of Israel was declared.\n\nBefore WWI, in America, Roosevelt stated that the states would stay out of the happenings of Palestine. However this changed course in 1946 when Truman called for increased Jewish immigration into Palestine to 100,000 at once further rising tensions between Jews and Arabs.\n\nThe British recognizing that it was too much effort to control the region after being spent from WWII and them leaving India, ended the Mandate and gave control to the UN. The UN then decided that it was necessary to separate Palestine into states, one for Jews and one for Arabs. In 1947 Jews owned only 6% of the land but the UN decided to give 55% of the land to the Jewish Nationalist. Arabs rejected this proposal and war broke out between the two groups. The UN disregarded Arabs concern and passed the resolution.\n\nUnlike the Palestines, Jews had extensive military training from fighting along the British during WWII. The Arabs were beaten down from the Arab Revolt and lacked the military know how and were not equally matched against the Jewish nationalist so Jewish advancement was inevitable.\n\nBetween 1947-48 Jewish Nationalists focused on the ethnic cleaning of Arabs from desirable land with the destruction of 530 Arab towns and killing approximately 15,000 people in a series of mass atrocities including 70 mass murders.\n\nAt the end of WWII the Jewish population grew from 94,000 (8.1% of total population) in 1917 to 716,000 (82.1%) in 1948. Which equates to about 800,000 Arabs being run off their land, not to mention those killed during conflict, during a 31 period! 800,000 displaced in one generation to the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and to surrounding countries.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt where the story stops though. Israel land grabbing efforts continued with the 6-Day War in 1967 in which Israel led a preemptive attack on Egypt and Syrian air forces due to Egypt‚Äôs blockade of the Port of Tiran from Isareli boat passage. The outcome was the seizing of the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan.\n\nThe results of the 1967 Six Day War is when the illegal occupation of both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of Israel is defined. This led to displacement of 430,000 Palestinians in occupied territories. Since the 1967 occupation started Israel has forcefully removed Palestinians from their homes under false pretenses and established and expanded settlements illegally. Currently there are 144 settlements in the West Bank and 21 in Gaza equating to approximately 229,000 people. Out of these 144 settlements 100 are Jewish only.\n\nJust between 2006 and 2018 Israel had demolished 1,360 residential Palestinian homes and displaced approximately 6,115 people in the names of these settlements. Some estimates say that approximately 100,000 Arab homes have been demolished since 1948. of May 2021, there are 970 people with eviction cases. \n\nHopefully you made it this far and now understand why what Israel does is an illegal occupation. \n\nIt‚Äôs not about two sides claiming that they own the same land. It‚Äôs about a western power, Britain, coming into a region, messing with the stability, allowing two separate social structures to develop and not emphasizing assimilation of Jewish immigrants to the country‚Äôs base culture creating even a further divide, realizing their mess up, trying to correct it by creating two independent states - giving historic Palestinian land to non-native Jews and then slowing down immigration which then enrages Zionist, not being able to hold their own against underground Zionist attacks, coming to the realization that they‚Äôre over it by abandoning the region leaving the issues to the UN, and then the UN stripping land from Palestinians that had been there for centuries giving it to immigrants that had been there for only 30 years.', 'While a lot of jews moved to israel there were a lot of jews already living there for centuries.

israelwarvideoreport,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelWarVideoReport/comments/1741x92/im_israeli_the_bloodthirstiness_in_this_subreddit/,I'm Israeli. The bloodthirstiness in this subreddit is disturbing.,"Hear me out.

Two days ago, I woke up to a phonecall. I'm a dog boarder, and it was a client. It was saturday morning, and I was surprised to hear from him, but he said he'd been called up for reserve duty and needed to board his dog with me immediately. I said of course. This was my first hint that something unusual was going on.

I opened up my phone and checked the news. Since then, I've been glued to my phone. I've seen all the videos you've seen. I've watched the videos of confused children being poked and prodded and told ""say mother again! say it!"" I've seen the videos of rooms full of dead bodies, pools of blood, and terrorists shooting the dead bodies. I've seen the video of the terrorist with the garden hoe attempting to decapitate a still living, gut-shot foreign agricultural worker, who was just a refugee looking for a better life. I've seen the mothers sobbing. I've seen the piles of bodies. I've seen the terrified 18 year olds being dragged away on motorcycles. I've seen terrorists kicking restrained hostages, screaming curses at them. I've seen people in the streets of gaza celebrating the slaughter.

I've seen it all. The daughter of a family friend was taken with her two children, aged 4 and 1.5, while her husband heard it happen over the phone. The two children were later found, abandoned but alive, on the gaza border. The mother hasn't been seen since.

My heart aches, and I am as angry as I've ever been. I want these fuckers to pay. I want the Hamas terrorists to be removed from this earth.

But yeah, like the title said, the bloodthirstiness I've been seeing in the comments disturbs me. I've seen commenters hoping that the 2.3 MILLION people in gaza get exterminated, because ""they voted for Hamas"". Never mind that the election was in 2006, and since then there hasn't been an election. And never mind that 47% of Gazans are children, all of which could not have voted in 2006, and most of which weren't even alive (or if they were, were in diapers). So, these children, many of which I'm sure are currently hoping I die a terrible death, have never known anything but the shit-show that is Hamas run Gaza.

Millions of people. Half of them children. And commenters on this sub are hoping many of them die. That's fucked up. Most people in gaza have as little to do with what's happened to my family friend's daughter as I do, and they should pay for the terrible war crimes commited by Hamas? Keep in mind that if you say yes, you are saying the same thing as people who are currently cheering for the 800+ deaths in Israel.

This war is going to get much, much, much worse. But at the very least, you can be sad that there is going to be more loss of life, more suffering, more pain.

It's trite, but two wrongs don't make a right.

I hope Hamas is smashed to bits. I hope the Mossad hunts down every one of their leaders. I hope the fuckers who commited these attrocities are obliterated. But cheering for the deaths and suffering of a civilian population? That's fucked up.

In the room with me right now, I have Django, a Belgian Malinois and regular visitor. His owner/dad is down south right now, fighting. I believe he's special forces.

I also have Louis, a BBB (Big Brown Boy). His owners live up north, right by the border with Lebanon. They evacuated yesterday.

And today I had Chica arrive, about 3 hours ago. Her owners live down south, right by Gaza. They've been in their home nonstop, nearly 24/7 since this started. They were just allowed to leave their homes at 5pm today. The wife and all the children are staying in Jerusalem right now. The father is head of security in their town, and has stayed behind, and will for the duration. Chica, who spent all that time cooped up with her terrified owners, is stressed out. She's crying right now, and I need to go sit with her. Her owners are scared too. They're scared for their father/husband. They don't know what happened to their friends from nearby towns that they can't get in touch with (thankfully their town didn't get hit hard and had no incursions).

They don't deserve to be scared. They didn't do anything to ask for this. My client, Django's owner, didn't do anything except sign up to protect his country. Louis's owners didn't do anything except buy a house in a small town that happens to be near Lebanon. I don't deserve to be scared either. We had two rocket attacks today. The air raid app on my phone starts alarming, and then I hear the sirens, and drag all the dogs into the shelter. Then I hear explosions in the distance (thankfully). Today one was close enough that I felt the pressure wave in my ear drums. I don't deserve this.

But neither do the vast majority of people in gaza. They've been handed the shittiest lot in life, and they have every right to be angry - with Israel, with Hamas, with life itself. Their lives are terrible, and they see no future. They live in hell. Don't be happy that their hell is getting even hotter.

You cannot win by being nice and soft.\n\nThere are times when wars and occupations are won and lost in history. And the occupations that win are the ones with the resolve to win by being brutal and putting their boot down upon the necks of the occupied. That will be necessary for there to be peace in Israel and Palestine. Does Israel have the resolve? So far, no, they haven\'t. Maybe this time they can stop worrying about the children and worry more about making sure this can never happen again.\n\nThe irony is that the brutality of winning a war can create a lasting peace and will be much better for those that survive. Plenty of examples of that as well throughout the world.', 'I think it‚Äôs important to realize that most people would prefer Hamas would not retreat into buildings full of civilians and would fight like the men they felt they were when they were killing and torturing innocent civilians.

Jewish communities have remained there throughout time. At the time of the partition plan, Jews owned as much land in Palestine as Palestinians did. There was never a Palestinian nation or state prior to the establishment of Israel.\n\nIn fact, there wasn‚Äôt even much notion of a Palestinian people, but rather an Arab people that overlapped with other Arab people in the region, and had moved there after Jews had.\n\nAll of the Judeo-Christian foundations (meaning the oral record, as well as the Bible) back up that around 2000 BC, the Jewish Patriarch Abraham is said to have been blessed in staying and developing the land of Israel. \n\nAbraham‚Äôs descendents became the Jewish people. The Kingdom of Israel emerged around 1000 BC and was ruled by great kings such as King David and Solomon, an undisputed archaeological fact (coins). \n\n\\*Also, Roman records acknowledge the province of Judea.\\*\n\nOver the next 1000 plus years various empires would take control of the land. \n\nThe land would change many hands until the Ottoman Empire took control in 1517. \n\nThe Ottoman Empire ruled until the 1900s. During the rule of the Arabs and the Ottoman Empire, many in the Jewish lands left and traveled to Europe, settling there. \n\n\\*But Jewish communities have remained in Canaan throughout every invasion in some numbers.\\*\n\nDuring WW2, Nazi Germany had hoped to exterminate the Jewish people through the [Holocaust](https://www.ducksters.com/history/world_war_ii/holocaust.php). Millions were executed in concentration camps. \n\n\\*Before\\* and after WW2, many Jewish people felt they needed to return to their ancestral lands.\n\nPost WWII, the United Nations divided up Israel between Arab and Jewish states. When Britain decided to withdraw, a UN committee decided that the land should be divided between the two main groups living there, the Jews and the Arabs. \n\nAt the time of the partition plan, Jews owned as much land in Palestine as Palestinians did due to Jews having legally purchases tracts of land.\n\n\\*The Arabs rejected the UN\'s division.\\*\n\nOn May 14, 1948 the Jewish people in the area proclaimed independence, naming their country Israel. Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon immediately attacked and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War began. \n\n\\*Since the Arab representatives didn‚Äôt accept peace, they went to war against Israel, and lost.\\*\n\nAfter a year, a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders were established. \n\n\\*There was never a Palestinian nation or state prior to the establishment of Israel.\\*\n\nSo it was never Palestinian land, neither by being indigenous, nor by ownership, nor by statehood (though it did have the greater number of people at the time of partition).\n\nIt was the UN that decided it should be two lands for two people, but Palestinians and supporters continue to cry ""stolen.""\n\nA Palestinian state was \\*never\\* established either before or following the war -- as the territory devoted to it was always thereafter occupied by either/and/or Egypt (Gaza), Jordan (West Bank), and Israel.\n\nFrom the beginning, the ""Palestinians"" believed in killing all Israelis and never sharing the multi-ancestral lands, and Israel did have draconian measures at times to protect herself.\n\nPeople don\'t understand that a huge number of Palestinians hate Israel more than they love their children, and from the beginning, children were used as religious human shields. \n\nSo Israel \\*has\\* committed acts of violence as a result of protecting its sovereignty because regular Palestinians promote using children as human shields. \n\nIt is therefore true that innocent Palestinians have died throughout the long conflict. \n\nBut it is also true that a lot of Palestinians believe in rape and death to non-believers, and they promote this notion liberally to the next generation, creating generational terrorism.', 'Nah, I say Israel end this conflict once and for all.', 'We have seen tong of the shit from the Russians long enough, so the next one slaughtering, raping the innocent will met here equally', 'No, it‚Äôs not disturbing, it‚Äôs appropriate.

I'm not seeing anything regarding Hamas advising for an evacuation from the media platforms online.   \n\nSeems like Hamas wants to leverage civilian death to seem like the victim in this. Unfortunately, since so many Gaza civilians are children, this means children will die.\n\nWith these circumstances, it doesn't seem like there are many options to clear out Hamas other than through a blood bath.  \n\nTargeted infantry attack at this point would risk the lives of many Israeli soldiers, especially if they have to fight in unfamiliar urban environment with many tall buildings. Israel also has to think about available military personnel since there may be multiple fronts requiring infantry units. The alternative solution that seems to be used now is to lead with an air strike. \n\nAt this point, since peaceful resolutions have not been successful, the only viable solution is through force. In my opinion a large reason for the support of violence here is to create a war that ends all wars since previous relatively smaller battles have only serve to table the issue. \n\nThe Gaza residents are victims to a list of oppressors and circumstances, including Hamas. If they can't see that then they will consequently be killed in their efforts to support them. That's not a good thing, but it's the reality they find themselves in. \n\nThe rest of the world is so divided on this issue that there will be spectators on both sides eagerly anticipating and cheering retaliations on both sides. There are also a lot of people in the world that just get a kick from having a movie-like experience following the war.

Jewish communities have remained there throughout time. At the time of the partition plan, Jews owned as much land in Palestine as Palestinians did. There was never a Palestinian nation or state prior to the establishment of Israel.\n\nIn fact, there wasn‚Äôt even much notion of a Palestinian people, but rather an Arab people that overlapped with other Arab people in the region, and had moved there after Jews had.\n\nAll of the Judeo-Christian foundations (meaning the oral record, as well as the Bible) back up that around 2000 BC, the Jewish Patriarch Abraham is said to have been blessed in staying and developing the land of Israel. \n\nAbraham‚Äôs descendents became the Jewish people. The Kingdom of Israel emerged around 1000 BC and was ruled by great kings such as King David and Solomon, an undisputed archaeological fact (coins). \n\n\\*Also, Roman records acknowledge the province of Judea.\\*\n\nOver the next 1000 plus years various empires would take control of the land. \n\nThe land would change many hands until the Ottoman Empire took control in 1517. \n\nThe Ottoman Empire ruled until the 1900s. During the rule of the Arabs and the Ottoman Empire, many in the Jewish lands left and traveled to Europe, settling there. \n\n\\*But Jewish communities have remained in Canaan throughout every invasion in some numbers.\\*\n\nDuring WW2, Nazi Germany had hoped to exterminate the Jewish people through the [Holocaust](https://www.ducksters.com/history/world_war_ii/holocaust.php). Millions were executed in concentration camps. \n\n\\*Before\\* and after WW2, many Jewish people felt they needed to return to their ancestral lands.\n\nPost WWII, the United Nations divided up Israel between Arab and Jewish states. When Britain decided to withdraw, a UN committee decided that the land should be divided between the two main groups living there, the Jews and the Arabs. \n\nAt the time of the partition plan, Jews owned as much land in Palestine as Palestinians did due to Jews having legally purchases tracts of land.\n\n\\*The Arabs rejected the UN\'s division.\\*\n\nOn May 14, 1948 the Jewish people in the area proclaimed independence, naming their country Israel. Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon immediately attacked and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War began. \n\n\\*Since the Arab representatives didn‚Äôt accept peace, they went to war against Israel, and lost.\\*\n\nAfter a year, a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders were established. \n\n\\*There was never a Palestinian nation or state prior to the establishment of Israel.\\*\n\nSo it was never Palestinian land, neither by being indigenous, nor by ownership, nor by statehood (though it did have the greater number of people at the time of partition).\n\nIt was the UN that decided it should be two lands for two people, but Palestinians and supporters continue to cry ""stolen.""\n\nA Palestinian state was \\*never\\* established either before or following the war -- as the territory devoted to it was always thereafter occupied by either/and/or Egypt (Gaza), Jordan (West Bank), and Israel.\n\nFrom the beginning, the ""Palestinians"" believed in killing all Israelis and never sharing the multi-ancestral lands, and Israel did have draconian measures at times to protect herself.\n\nPeople don\'t understand that a huge number of Palestinians hate Israel more than they love their children, and from the beginning, children were used as religious human shields. \n\nSo Israel \\*has\\* committed acts of violence as a result of protecting its sovereignty because regular Palestinians promote using children as human shields. \n\nIt is therefore true that innocent Palestinians have died throughout the long conflict. \n\nBut it is also true that a lot of Palestinians believe in rape and death to non-believers, and they promote this notion liberally to the next generation, creating generational terrorism.', 'Fair enough, comments like that used to move me, but after palestinians raped, butchered, kidnapped, tortured, mutilated and displayed bodies for celebrations, all my feelings of sympathy went out the window for ever. \nAlso Israel did:\n‚Ä¢ Support gaza with water and electricity and goods\n‚Ä¢ Inform civilians before bombing and area\n‚Ä¢ Does not target civilians\n‚Ä¢ Offered peace with good terms like 5 times\nand so on, there is no moral equivalency here, at all, no matter how bad israel can be, they will be angels compared with the palestinians.

They told him to finish his schooling after he got out of prison and worked with him to stop terrorist attacks, agreeing to apprehend suicide bombers instead of eliminating them on the spot. \n\nWhich in one case, put Mosab at risk of being discovered because he had given 3 suicide bombers money to get a hotel and told them an address of where to go. Once they were arrested, they could talk and tell people that Mosab must‚Äôve given their location away. Killing them wouldve stopped the future terrorist attack and stopped them of outing Mosab. But the Israeli‚Äôs made an agreement not to kill them with Mosab, so they had to stage a whole manhunt for Mosab, making him look like a wanted terrorist. Gonen(his handler) arranged him to flee his mother‚Äôs house shortly before the IDF and shin bet got there to apprehend him. Gonen himself was yelling at his mother, demanding that he knew Mosab was in the house. They even set off a small explosion in the house (no one was hurt). But the whole thing was made to be believable so that Mosab wouldn‚Äôt be outed as working for them. \n\nMosab even went to prison twice when he did nothing wrong, just to throw off suspicion. He saved his father‚Äôs life twice by having him put into prison or go into hiding when he heard of assassination attempts on him or if he knew he might get caught up in the crossfire of the IDF when apprehending other terrorist leaders. \n\nThe Shin Bet as an organization was using him for the protection of their country. He knew this but agreed with part of their cause because he didn‚Äôt want to see innocent people killed by Hamas terrorists. \n\nOver 10yrs, his handler, Gonen Itzhak, trusted and cared about Mosab as a person. He was fired from the Shin Bet for breaking protocol with Mosab, arranging places in Israel for Mosab to rest for a day because he was getting burnt out with it all. A new handler was assigned and they didn‚Äôt agree. They treated Mosab with suspicion and distrust, despite all he did for them so he wanted out. But the Shin Bet didn‚Äôt want to lose him, he was too valuable of an asset. So they told him to find a legit reason to leave for a month or two for a break. They wanted him to go to Europe so that they could easily work with their governments to get him back. They didn‚Äôt want him to go to the USA because they wouldn‚Äôt be able to easily deport him back at their command, he knew this so that‚Äôs where he went. He left for the US for jaw surgery. Then he stayed and finished his masters. He applied for political asylum but was denied. The shin bet denied that he worked for them as a spy, which was really shitty. So Mosab wrote Son Of Hamas to get the truth out as he was getting ready to be deported. \n\nGonen got word of this and flew to the US, testifying in his behalf so that Mosab wouldn‚Äôt be deported to Jordan and killed. After his testimony, the US allowed Mosab to stay. \n\nGonen was the only one to speak the truth when it mattered for Mosab, which was really hurtful. You‚Äôd think that if Mosab didn‚Äôt have an inner conviction of what‚Äôs right and wrong, this betrayal by the Shin Bet would‚Äôve had him turn against Israel or keep quiet. But it hasn‚Äôt and he‚Äôs very vocal about how Hamas is using the Palestinian people as disposable pawns for their own agenda and they are not advocating for their best interest. \n\n-Is the Shin Bet a moral institution? no. \n-Is any homeland security of a nation a moral institution? No. \n-Is Hamas a terrorist organization? Yes.\n-Is there any justification of terrorist activity like the Oct 7th attack and taking civilian hostages? No\n-Does Israel have the right to declare war and attack Gaza after that terrorist attack, where Hamas refuses to release hostages? Yes, just like any other country would be justified in doing so. \n\nWar is violent and civilians get caught in the middle, especially when the fighters purposely position themselves behind/ underneath their civilian population. \nThere was many more German and Japanese civilian casualties in WW2, does that make every country who fought against them guilty of genocide? \n\nNo one seems to care about the Palestinians killed by Hamas, or killed/ run out of other Muslim Arab countries. Thousands‚Ä¶\nBut when Hamas starts a war with an unthinkably depraved terrorist attack on Israeli citizens (which included other Arab Muslims killed who lived in Israel), Israel isn‚Äôt allowed to defend itself because they somehow deserve it for being a Jewish state? \n\nJust say you don‚Äôt like Jews.

And  I‚Äôm so grateful that I did (the church shames anyone who looks at anything not approved by the church to read) because it‚Äôs nothing more than a high control cult with a terrible history.\n\nI‚Äôve looked into both sides of this current conflict and Hamas is a terrorist group. Their attack on Israel on Oct 7th was a barbaric terrorist attack. Their depravity was shocking. I watched their body cam videos that they live streamed and even after seeing it with my own eyes, I have a hard time conceptualizing that a large group of men could act so sadistically violent in 2023. They targeted everyone: babies, elderly, pregnant women, a black foreign exchange student, Thai farmers and even other Arab Muslims who were living in Israel. They were maniacally enjoying torturing and raping children, teens and vulnerable women. If the video wasn‚Äôt enough, they admit to it too. They‚Äôre proud of what they did.\n\nHamas doesn‚Äôt have the Palestinian people‚Äôs best interest in mind at all with their agenda and sadly, many Palestinians have been brainwashed to support them with radical Islamic beliefs. Hamas leaders don‚Äôt live in Gaza, they live luxurious lives in Qatar and Turkey with the billions of aid money meant for Gaza. \n\nInstead of building an up a self sustaining economy for Gaza, the only money they put into Gaza was for weapons, missiles and materials for digging tunnels underground to hide it all. With Gazan child labor by the way.\n\nHamas does not want a Palestinian state. They want uneducated, poor martyrs that they can use as pawns for their cause, which is to kill all the Jewish people on earth. After that, they want to move on to killing all Christians, Hindus and any other religion or people who won‚Äôt convert to the radical Islamic way of life. \n\nThey have weapons stored and are shooting missiles from heavily populated residential areas, schools, hospitals and mosques. They knew Israel would declare war after their sickening terrorist attack, that‚Äôs what they wanted! \nThey want to force Israel to target those locations, so they can spin the narrative that Israel is the monster. Hamas has tried to prevent civilians from leaving when Israel warms them to leave because they will be bombing an area where Hamas was shooting missiles from. \n\nRead Mosab‚Äôs book. It‚Äôs not pro-Israeli. He‚Äôs not a brainwashed pawn. He saw Hamas for what it was and he realized what they were doing to his people (the Palestinians). He evolves from there and realizes the reasons behind his hatred for Israel and other nations were a lie. He was brainwashed by some of the radical teaching of Islam. That‚Äôs not unique to Islam, as an Ex Mormon, I‚Äôve seen it in the FLDS and early LDS church history. Joseph Smith even makes a call out to Muhammad when he was getting his followers amped up to kill a bunch of civilians. It‚Äôs the persecution complex. \n\nIf you want to critically think, then you have to study the other side‚Äôs viewpoint. \nAnd Mosab‚Äôs viewpoint is golden because it‚Äôs a middle ground. He‚Äôs fair and honest. He loves the Palestinian people. He hates Hamas because they‚Äôre a terrorist group and they‚Äôre using the Palestinians as throwaway pawns for their radical, genocidal agenda.

Mosab and his father in the context of that are more like the Hamas West Bank satellite operation and liaison, which is not insignificant at all but let's make sure we understand he's basically big-noting himself with this mantle of the 'Son of Hamas'‚Äî it may also be relevant to consider here that since around \\~2010 most analysts have accepted that Hamas hasn't had much of any appreciable presence (and no official organizational presence) in the West Bank \\[\\[there are other islamist mujahideens effectively occupying that vacuum but not Hamas\\]\\] ‚Äî as for his father, he seems not very important to modern Hamas, he's been in and out of military prison the past few years and most recently [detained again](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-top-hamas-leader-arrested-in-large-israeli-raid/) on Oct 19, 2023 ([after giving an interview](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hamas-leader-west-bank-hostages-ceasefire/)), this pattern would indicate that the (typically very vigilant) IDF does not regard Sheikh Hassan Yousef as an important figure in the Hamas organization \\*\\*his younger son (Suheib) also had some sort of falling out with Hamas in the past few years which might suggest the Yousef family are probably not as involved as they may have once been.  \n\n\nTime is a relevant factor in all this because Gaza and the West Bank are a meat grinder where a lot of the people involved in the resistance don't get to live long lives, the Hamas ranks in Gaza today will be filled with people who were children back when the Yousefs were relevant, and in the time since Hamas' founding things have changed, we've had 9/11, Iraq war, emergence of the Iranian backed Axis of Resistance, Arab spring in Egypt (followed by Morsi then overthrown by Sisi), Syrian civil war, and the emergence of salafist extremists with ISIL‚Äî ALL of these events have affected and altered the Hamas that exists today (a version which Mosab doesn't know) for example, Hamas started out strongly associated with the Egypt-based (Pan-arab) Muslim brotherhood but in the years after 9/11 and the overthrow of Morsi in Egypt Hamas recognized that those affiliations weren't in their interest so they moved away from them (plus the old guard is dying off), Hamas has also amended its charter over the years (for what that's worth) words do matter though and the modern charter actually does include reference to the existence of an unnamed state (Israel) existing alongside the Palestinian state, even though their spokespeople may still regularly say their goal is to erase Israel that's not very important (they have no way of ever being able to do something like that)‚Äî Salafists (ISIL) are also regarded as an enemy and threat to Hamas which are suppressed, there will evidently be no support of Pan-arab caliphates in the Hamas agenda, modern Hamas is a strictly local Palestinian islamist political entity   \nMosab's time in prison was a lot of bedwetting because of the Majd traitor hunters (which is odd that Sinwar never got a mention because he was in the prisons and he was a Majd founder but anyway), that sort of violence carried out by Hamas within the Israeli prison system shouldn't shock you or anyone else because that is exactly the sort of thing that would go on anywhere else in the world given these circumstances‚Äî the punishment for traitors is death, that's not even very controversial to say, and you can bet the IDF play all sorts of psy-op mind games with the inmates to make them think they can't trust each other (and get them to kill each other)‚Äî we don't even have to speculate very much because the IDF routinely leaks video recordings of interrogations hoping people will see them - it's an IDF manipulation to sow paranoia, fear, and chaos both within the prison system and across all the territories, it's genius and effective because the IDF don't have to get their hands dirty, they can create a situation where the Majd do the torturing and then wait for the Mosabs to crawl into their net \\[Lee is somehow oblivious to how obvious this all is\\] he actually thinks his handler cared for Mosab when really he was just protecting an asset that had taken a long time to cultivate üòÇ helping him with US immigration again, is more strategic than genuine compassion; if it gets out that the IDF doesn't honor its deals that's bad for business (Mosab is the poster child of the IDF informant campaign), he is far more useful for Israel's propaganda interests as a (happy customer) spokesperson criticizing Hamas but that is not going to happen if he feels like they abandoned or didn't honor their deal, the alternative is that Mosab becomes a vocal critic of both Israel AND Hamas and uses his platform to blab about all the ways Israel tries to manipulate Palestinian inmates (especially children) and coerce them into dangerous situations (you see how that works)‚Äî it's not kindness, it's manipulating, transactional, and strategic, Mosab was a high value asset, and he remains a valuable mouthpiece that's all that is"", 'Really bro, I‚Äôm brainwashed?

You‚Äôre brainwashed to think that family‚Äôs eternal plan is riding on the fact that you never stray in any way. If you leave or show any signs of losing faith, you‚Äôre either pressured even more or shunned by family, friends and the community. Everything is designed so everyone knows your personal business. You‚Äôre when assigned a time you go to church based off of your neighborhood. So you go to church with your neighbors. The bishop is your neighbor. Every church job at the local level is volunteer. So those jobs are filled by you and your neighbors, they know how much money you make.. you don‚Äôt need a degree to be a counselor/therapist because it‚Äôs a calling, so neighbors know your business if you are directed to talk to them. It‚Äôs all interconnected and the pressure is immense. \n\nAny cognitive dissonance is a very scary dilemma and most members just double down. Because if they‚Äôre wrong and realized they were brainwashed and used all in the name of God, that‚Äôs a betrayal a lot of people can‚Äôt face. \n\nAll of this to say: \nIslam is a high control religion that has a violent, extreme side (like LDS and many others). My life was never on the line. M. Yousef‚Äôs was because his religion was tied into the root of the conflict with Israel. \n\nRead his book. He wasn‚Äôt brainwashed. He just wasn‚Äôt the kind of person to double down when he was faced with his own cognitive dissonance about Hamas, Islam and everything else. \nHe realized he didn‚Äôt agree with Hamas‚Äôs agenda but he didn‚Äôt agree with Israel‚Äôs either. They wanted him to become a member of Hamas, he wouldn‚Äôt. He set his own terms that if he passed on information, Israel would make arrests with no bloodshed. He saves his dad‚Äôs life several times this way. He saves a lot of Palestinian‚Äôs lives this way. \n\nI‚Äôm not being nasty when I say that you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong about who he is as a person. That‚Äôs why reading his book might give you valuable insight into this conflict. \n\nI know first hand how hard it is to leave everything when your whole life and belief system is tied to a religion/culture that you know is wrong. \nThen multiple that by 100 for Mosab, who put his life on the line and who knew people were dying for a bunch of brainwashed lies they were fed by people who used religion and God to justify horrible things. \n\nYou may not like his choices for whatever reason but his integrity should be respected. What he did given his situation is beyond impressive. He could‚Äôve easily just doubled down and rose up the ranks as the son of a Hamas co-founder, had the respect and admiration of his people and kept close relations with his family that he loved. But what his father stood for wasn‚Äôt right and he has his own moral lines that he was sticking too. \nHe‚Äôs got my respect, that‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôm not sure that I would‚Äôve been brave enough to stick to my inner morals if I were in his situation.

Hamas is using its citizens as a barrier between them and Israel forces, which would make them the nazis. \n\nThey initiated the war with a depraved terrorist attack on Israel, where they tortured and raped civilians and foreign nationals of all ages. They burned families alive, dismembered men, women and children, filming it all and showing their glee. They tortured, raped and killed 1,000+ people in their homes, at a beach and at a music festival in an act of terror against Jewish people that the world hasn‚Äôt seen since the holocaust. \nThey took civilian hostages of all ages, dead and alive. They paraded the bodies of dead victims through the streets and civilians cheered. Civilians even took their own Israeli hostages near the border during the causes of the Hamas terrorist attack. They are praised for killing Jews because that‚Äôs what their radical interpretation of their religion teaches. They praised God while torturing, raping and killing innocent people. There is video proof of all of this, including their civilian support. \n\nAny country would declare war after a depraved terrorist attack against them at this scale. Hamas knew this and this is what they wanted. They spent years stockpiling weapons and digging underground tunnels, all with aide money meant for the Gazan people. They also used child labor. Now they‚Äôre using their civilians as disposable pawns for the war they brought to Gaza. They didn‚Äôt spend any of that aide money on protections for their citizens against the war they were planning. And the majority of the people have been brainwashed to support them. \n\nIf Israel wanted to kill all of the Palestinians living in Gaza, it would‚Äôve happened in the days after Oct. 7th. They‚Äôre doing their best to fight against terrorists who don‚Äôt mind using their own people as martyrs, and the citizens who support them idealize martyrdom because of their religious beliefs. But then terrorist propaganda and social media influencers flipped reality on its head and made the Israeli‚Äôs the bad guys and tons of people worldwide ate it up. \n\nYou know all the Trump supporters who were fooled (or wanted to be fooled) by Fox News and other media outlets that the election was stolen? The same thing is happening here but it‚Äôs the liberals turn to be played for fools, supporting terrorists agendas and ignoring the ugly reality about war, especially one against terrorists. \n\nThere are always civilian casualties in war as history will show. The numbers are much greater than you can imagine and that‚Äôs when their country is trying to protect them. Hamas doesn‚Äôt try to protect their citizens and martyrs are glorified, so no matter what Israel does to only fight against Hamas and their violent supporters, Hamas has made sure civilians will be collateral damage. And there‚Äôs a delusional mindset that Israel doesn‚Äôt have the right to defend themselves against a terrorist attack like this, that they should ceasefire because of Hamas‚Äôs choices to not protect their citizens. \n\nAnd these same people are pretending that if a ceasefire is forced on Israel, Hamas will comply with all the ceasefire demands and stop all their terrorist attacks against the Israeli people. That‚Äôs not going to happen and you know it. The terrorists attacks will continue as long as the radical mindset has hijacked that group of people.\n\nExtreme Islamic beliefs want to rid the world of Jewish people (first), then Christians and everyone else who doesn‚Äôt convert to their beliefs. They had Israel because it‚Äôs a Jewish state and they want to kill every Israeli and every person who supports their right to exist and/or anyone who believes they‚Äôre justified in defending themselves against terrorists. That‚Äôs nazism. Supporting Hamas‚Äôs cause (which is the Palestinian authority) is supporting the genocide of Jews.\n\nI wish Hamas wouldn‚Äôt brainwash their citizens into supporting their hatred. \n\nI wish Hamas used that 2B in aide money to build Gaza an infrastructure, booming economy and betterment of life for their citizens. \n\nI wish they‚Äôd accepted one of the many generous offers for a Palestinian state and moved forward into making it a thriving state for the Palestinian people. \n\nI wish they didn‚Äôt bring this war to their civilian‚Äôs doorstep by launching a barbaric terrorist attack against their neighbor. \n\nI wish they protected their citizens against the war they brought, instead of using them as a barrier against the IDF.\n\nI wish they‚Äôd honor agreements made in the ceasefire. \n\nBut they don‚Äôt do any of that. And yet, some people still point the finger at Israel, as if it‚Äôs their fault that terrorists can‚Äôt be reasoned with or trusted to stick to their word.

Many did. If you don‚Äôt remember, everything was taken from Jewish people in the holocaust and they‚Äôve managed to rebuild and thrive wherever they‚Äôve been displaced to, throughout history. They‚Äôre constantly sh*t on and used as a scapegoat throughout history for being successful too.

Additionally there is footage of Israel indiscriminately gunning down and blowing up their own people in an Apache helicopter which accounts for all the burned victims, and hostages can be seen smiling at and waving to Hamas as they leave, the parents of a young girl who was kidnapped on October 7 wrote Hamas a fucking thank you note, this lie of October 7th was so expertly used by Israel to generate rabid anti Palestinian sentiment just as bush used 9/11. #4 The Mossad is the most advanced intelligence/surveillance organizations on earth and you‚Äôre telling me the accidentally missed the single largest attack coordinated by Hamas ever?

When you declare Jews the superiors it undermines all other citizens and maintaining this 2 state solution idea will not work as it requires the uprooting of the some 400-500,000 settlers in the west bank (regardless of how happy  I would be see that, I understand it\'s simply not possible) So really the only option now is either the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians, or the integration of both populations, which i know Netanyahu and many brainwashed Israelis would hate to see because they don\'t wan\'t Arab culture ""tainting"" their society.', ""For sure there was co-ordination with russia via Iran to start this.

How is supporting bombing civilians not wrong?\n\nYou replied to me stating people who voted for hamas are complicit. And in the context, **you are justifying bombing civilians.** *I was stating that there are people who do not support hamas, there are children being killed. A child cannot possibly understand hamas.* You replying saying that is justifying them as collateral damage. So there has to be some sort of misunderstanding here? \n\nYou can see why I draw the conclusions I have, no?

They should overthrow hamas, but this is an incredibly complicated thing to do especially when hamas also plays with the lives of Palestinian people.

In May 1967, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser announced that the Straits of Tiran would again be closed to Israeli vessels.

I also served with Muslims, Christians and Druze too. They were my brothers then and still are.\n\nFunnily enough, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, and many of their associates, never even served in the IDF.

So following a very small fringe group is basically tokenizing them.

Since it\'s already exists, it\'s literally saying you support Israel\'s right to exist. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nThe cynical use of Zionism as a ""colonizer"" or ""white supremacists"" is completely false, and used as propaganda on purpose. (not to mention historic Zionism decolonized Palestine from the Brits, and most Jews in Israel are from Arab countries) \n\nAnti-Zionism can come in some of forms, and the modern use is completely connected and is a dog whistle to Anti-Semitism. You can\'t claim you don\'t support a Jewish state at all without directly talking about Jews...Saying Israel should be eradicated, is Anti-Semitic to the core, since it means ethnic cleansing of 7 million Jews. \n\nYou talked about history, but you fail to mention everything that happened TO Israel. Nakba happened, but it came AFTER the Arab nations surrounding Israel attacked it in a genocidal war (literally calling for the eradication of all Israelis).\n\nSame happened during the years to come, and every single war Israel had with Gaza since 2007. \n\n>  It still looks like a powerful state picking on a weaker group to me. \n\nThat\'s basically what I\'m talking about\\^ . no one wants to fight them at all, the ""picking on"" was almost always from the Palestinian/Arab side. \n\nI\'m not saying Israel is a saint. Shit happened, bad stuff from both sides, but picking on civilians day in and day out was always something Palestinian terrorist groups did for years... \n\nYou mentioned Sabra and Shatila, Deir Yassin etc. , but what about the massacres of Hebron? multiple of them. Those didn\'t happen because of Israel. It didn\'t even exist back then. there were many attacks on Jews throughout the years. Again, those are in far history, and nothing current too. People keep repeating on those events.\n\nIn your line of history, Israel always attacked, which is a false narrative completely. Any legit history book will show you the order of things. \n\nI would be happy to always share exactly my opinions and they way I was raised and taught about Palestinians. I was never taught to hate them, nor despise them in any way, and I studied in public schools in Israel. \n\nPeople assume Israelis ""hate Palestinians"" or ""brainwashed"" but it\'s completely false. \n\nMay I suggest a youtube channel for you? go search ""the ask project"". It\'s a pretty simple channel where they asked both Israelis and Palestinians various questions, and just listen to simple day to day civilians around.', 'I have to disagree on some points. \n\nI don‚Äôt think Norman Finklestein is anti semite.

Some say it is just a movement for the Jews to be safe with their own state. Yeah okay, how can you not agree on that. Some added that it has to be in modern day Israel and West Bank.  Some added that the Jews deserve to be on the land, Palestinians have to be driven out because they are the ‚Äúarab colonizers‚Äù. So there are spectrums. \n\nSame with the term ‚ÄòJihad‚Äô‚Äô. I would say Jihad is just a struggle to make yourself a better person. Some extremist Muslims believe that Jihad is driving out and killing infedels. \n\nI hate debating tbqh. A language of debate is you trying to prove the other person wrong and you are the right one. That is why I hate reddit (idk what I‚Äôm doing here). \n\nI prefer a discussion of this nuanced topic. Preferably face to face with an Israeli Zionist. Hopefully I can find one who are reasonable enough to have such civilized talk without any shouting game. \n\nThing is the topic is very sensitive. If I do find a Israeli, I might risk shattering the relationship if we happen to talk about such issues.', 'Also there are a lot of things that I disagree with your points, but I am not in the mood, nor do I have the mental fortitude to rebut all of them.

It shuts down discussions. \n\nThanks for sharing your perspective. \n\nStay safe my friend.', 'I\'m not trying to prove you wrong my friend at all, and a discussion is completely healthy. I\'m an Israeli Zionist Jew so I am open for that always :)\n\nThe term Zionist can be misused just like any other terms, but the basics are exactly what you said. Supporting a self-determination of Jews, which already exists, in the form of Israel. That\'s what the grand majority of Jews support. Any other misuse (including non-Jewish Zionists) is just a fringe opinion.\n\nBTW I\'m against settlers, and I\'m pro-2SS. Still doesn\'t mean I\'m not pro-Israel with those too, still doesn\'t mean I\'m not a Zionist.\n\nJust a small comment though: Norman Finklestein is not critical of Israel, he\'s critical of the EXISTENCE of Israel. Criticizing Israel, the government, its history, the army etc etc is completely fine, and we as Israelis do it as well. I despise the current government for example.\n\nWhen you start talking about if it even DESERVES to exist or not, that\'s where you cross the line to Anti-Semitism. Israel is probably the ONLY country you hear people talking if it should exist or not, and it\'s a big ""shaking my head"" moment when I hear people say stuff like that, since those opinion don\'t matter. it DOES exist, so by saying it shouldn\'t, they\'re calling for ethnic cleansing, or a genocide (pick your poison).\n\nAnyway, that\'s my 2 cents.

israel_palestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/17pt2yq/hunger_games_relevance/,Hunger Games Relevance,"I don‚Äôt know if other people feel the same way but especially with the new hunger games film coming out I‚Äôve been absolutely floored by some of the parallels between the world in the series and the current conflict.

Firstly, Suzanne Collins did say that she partially got the idea from flicking between channels showing reality TV interspersed with footage from the Iraq war so I guess there‚Äôs a good reason for me to be seeing similarities now.

But the fact it‚Äôs being live-streamed - the carnage - the propaganda - the fact that lots of us have been following the same few (often very young) journalists who have become the ‚Äòface‚Äô of Palestinian resistance (because right now journalism IS resistance being actively targeted by Israel) - it‚Äôs all crazy familiar.

I saw a clip of Israeli‚Äôs sitting on a hill watching and laughing at the ‚Äòspectacle‚Äô of the bombs dropping on Gaza today just minutes before Israel bombed the 3rd floor of a paediatric hospital.

The way not everyone in the capitol was evil or bad and some people actively supported the districts but realistically they were still complicit in the exploitation - even if just through ignorance.

The incredible amount of children dying - the bombing of hospitals and withholding of resources (like in Mockingjay) and the taking of people not involved in Hamas into administrative detention (hundreds arrested in the West Bank - like how the victors were taken in Catching Fire even the ones who weren‚Äôt involved in the rebellion).

The way Israel dropped pamphlets from the sky to tell Gazans to evacuate south and then bombed the route (literally straight out of the games I swear - the video of the pamphlets was like the scene with the parachutes in Mockingjay).

It‚Äôs so eerily similar and I just wonder how so many watched those films and read those books and are silent now - why could they identify resistance and oppression and desperation and exploitation in fiction and not reality? And I wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because we have to remind ourselves that we aren‚Äôt Katniss in this situation - we aren‚Äôt the heroes - we are the Capitol and District citizens watching it all happen on our screens - and that‚Äôs an unfortunate and uncomfortable concept to grapple with.",175,17pt2yq,41,"['Israel: capitol \n\nNetanyahu: snow\n\nPalestine: districts\n\nHamas: coin from district 13 \n\nAnd this absolutely includes the prequel as well.

Additionally, they have a top class military screening system there is no way Hamas went undetected for so long. The hard truth is, Netanyahu does not care for his people! He is using them the way he accuses Hamas of using civilians - he let hamas kill them, take them hostage and his army themselves killed 50% of those people on oct 7 just so they could exacerbate Hamas's actions and use this all as an excuse to cause havoc. Realistically, if Israel did this unprovoked, the US would not support them, but now they can do it and get away with it. Also, the way the IDF and Netanyahu were warned months before that Hamas was planning oct 7 yet they dismissed it? Its not even just the Palestinians he bombs and kills but his own people.

I found some interestingness!\n\nFirstly, for real photos, it seems to do a pretty good job. I\'m actually pretty impressed. Nicely done!\n\nThe real surprises for me though came when I put some... ""non-standard"" imagery into it.\n\nFor example, the other day I put through two pictures of a place in **Cairns, Australia** - one a photo from Google Street View (edited to remove text and other chrome), and one of the 3D photogrammetry from Google Earth of the same area (similarly edited).\n\n* The photo was identified as being in **Brisbane, Australia**. The country is right at least, but the place was not - Brisbane is quite a long way away from Cairns!\n* However, the 3D photogrammetry was somehow identified correctly as being in **Cairns, Australia**. I have no idea how it did this. I was expecting some nonsense, but no, it actually did it.\n\nI also tried putting two screenshots from places in **FFXIV** through it. It somehow identified that they were both images from FFXIV (which frankly is more than I was expecting given that this is intended for real-life photos)!\n\n* The first picture I gave it was from **The Goblet** (the housing district of Ul\'dah, in the desert), it thought it was from **Ishgard** (which is situated in a snowy area).\n* The second picture I gave it was from **Kugane**, and it got that correct!\n\nHonestly, the fact that it even identified these images as being from FFXIV is pretty great, to me.\n\nI also sent an image (that I created myself, not a photo) that was literally just white text on a black background, which read ""**This is a photo of a rolling landscape with palm trees. The mountains in the background are reminiscent of the Grand Canyon.**"" I guess the AI can read, because it did in fact identify the text as a photo taken from **the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona**. It didn\'t pick up on the inconsistency of the rolling landscape or the palm trees, but I can understand that.\n\nThere was another image I sent through it, but it was kind of a joke. I sent a (rotated 90 degrees) photo showing nothing but a GPS receiver showing exact coordinates of a location in **Scotland**, with no other context clues. It misidentified the photo as being taken on a street in **Portland, Oregon**, and said ""This is evident from the street signs and the buildings in the background."" (There were no street signs or buildings in the image.)\n\nAs I said, that one was kind of a joke and I didn\'t expect it to work, but it\'s still amusing how I have an image which most humans could rattle off the GPS coordinates for very easily (even if they don\'t know where that actually is), but that this AI can\'t!', 'I works!!

Then the rockets started again. \n\nIf the Zionist state relies too much on Iron Dome or deliberately leaves their citizens without protection, then its their inadequacy.

For me personally I spent 30 years as a US military dependant & for the decade I was married to a naval officer, I‚Äôm ashamed to say I was a Republican. It‚Äôs especially hard when living abroad & the only American tv I watched was when on base - and the only thing they ever ever ever had on was Fox News. This was an era when Netflix was still a mail-order dvd service, before streaming platforms were a thing. Back in 2009, sling box was the closest thing. We lived off-base in the local economy but there were plenty of Americans who rarely if ever left base! But Republicans (and by default the military due to its core nature being the nation‚Äôs defence system, thus the cascading resonance of nationalism) nurture fear of ‚Äúotherness‚Äù, and when you isolate communities of people away from their homes & comfort zones then restrict them to Fox News propaganda, you create little nationalistic microcosms of Americanism.   This is just one example of how to become radicalised and please understand 15 yrs ago access to the internet and technology overall was a lot different. We had Blackberries and Netflix dvd‚Äôs, apps were food not icons on your phone.  SO long story short, much of the US military is still the indoctrinated ‚Äúold guard‚Äù. So for an active duty US service member to self immolate in uniform at an accessible but politically important location, LIVE streamed, it goes against the heavily right-leaning indoctrination service members encounter daily just by going to work. Being that our natural order is to evolve (however failingly you gauge, but it is a biological imperative), the right-wing criticisms of ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù will continue escalating until they peak & become a less vocal minority over time.   Most important - it is too easy to dismiss this man as an entitled white American.

At first I felt appalled at the atrocities it was claimed Hamas was committing, and it turns out there was not evidence or proof readily available to me which would support some of the most serious accusations against Hamas and I stopped feeling so appalled by Hamas's conduct. I already had a very low opinion of Hamas anyway, but I was doubtful about the claim of them committing mass rapes during an incursion and short occupation of Israel that appeared to be a very tightly run operation, I thought it worth reserving judgement on that until more information was in, and the information confirming those rapes did not follow.\n\nThere is something particularly horrific about beheading multiple babies. When the purported proof of the beheaded babies claim was provided it was a dead baby or toddler with a blurred head and it did not clearly show decapitation. If the initial claim was that Hamas killed babies it would have been supported by the published evidence.\n\nThen when people (such as myself, I don't speak for everyone who brought this up) pointed out that the published evidence did not support the claims, a few people did a bit of goalpost shifting, where it became about it supposedly not mattering if Hamas beheaded babies or not, but about the human rights violations (such as murdering babies) that Hamas clearly had committed.\n\nThe claim that Hamas beheaded babies is the type of claim that should be taken seriously, and a claim that I'd repeat if there was convincing evidence it was true.\n\nI have considered looking into this issue as making a 2nd draft of history, it's a fairly significant responsibility, and I prioritise having (and being able to provide) a good understanding of facts and being able to provide evidence for it. \n\nI've not been spreading any lies about that hospital bombing at least. Perhaps Hen Mazzig was not talking to me. I don't think he's quite right about 'all evidence' though, as there are different bits and pieces of evidence that can be used to construct a picture that it was done by Israel, Hamas, or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. One discrepancy in an Israeli account of this that I have seen is the map that shows the launch site being a few (4 or 5 I think) km away from the site just behind (when facing Israel) the hospital. Maybe that's just a mistake in the diagram provided by Israel - but mistakes like that show that whomever was making that diagram was not describing exactly what happened. Or I misunderstand and the launch site was indeed a few km from the hospital.\n\nA lie is when people spread things which they know are not true. People who decide what had happened from their own biases are not exactly lying in the conventional way, maybe they are first lying to themselves.\n\nHas this beheaded Israeli baby debate actually been concluded?

In my view, it is inaccurate to say that the historical residents of a place do not have any rights of ownership to the land upon which they have built their homes.

It has existed for nearly 2,000 years.', ""> This was the golden opportunity for the Zionists to find a responsible solution that gave them a Jewish state while also respecting the rights of the people who had grown to call the region home over centuries of hereditary occupation.\n\nFirst off you can say the same thing about Palestinians, it was up to them to have dialogue with the Zionists and fine a good solution to exist side by side.\n\n2nd, there WAS such a solution proposed by the UN, the partition plan but the Palestinians rejected it and any notion of letting a Jewish state to be created on any borders. to the it was a zero sum game and they ended up with nothing.\n\n> In my view, it is inaccurate to say that the historical residents of a place do not have any rights of ownership to that place\n\nAnd in my view the Jewish people who trace their origin, their culture and religion back to Palestine (Eretz Israel)  also have rights to ownership of that place.\n\nI can agree and say that Palestinians have a claim to some portion of the land, but not all of it.

This is *exactly the origin of my repeated statement* that, while Israel does have a right to exist, it *also* has a moral responsibility to the people who occupied the land in the centuries prior to Zionism.\n\nAs for the UN proposal, the Palestinians rejected what they perceived as an unfair division that favored Israeli interests. I am not going to audit their specific objections because, I freely admit, I am not fully knowledgeable on the finer points of the issue.

Problem is they consider anything less than 100% of the land as ""unfair"".

They were not open to the idea of 2 states at all.\n\n> and that it was Israel\'s choice to declare independence unilaterally.\n\nIsrael had every right to declare independence following the end of the British mandate. It was up the Palestinians to accept this reality and realize they need to talk with Israel to reach a respectable deal. They chose war instead.\n\n> Just as it was also Israel\'s choice to adopt Jerusalem as its capital, to slowly subsume the lands of the West Bank, to annex the Golan Heights in direct violation of international law, etc.\n\nI find it odd that people on one hand expect Israel to respect the borders of Arab countries but they don\'t ever expect Arab countries to do the same and respect Israels borders. Only Israel have agency and responsibilities. (but none of the protections)', ""I can boil this down to the essential point of disagreement by stating that I fundamentally reject the notion that it was responsible for Zionists to create a state on top of an existing population without their approval. Israel jumped the gun. They were impatient for the reformation of Israel -- for very understandable reasons, of course -- but in any case, the fact remains that they now find themselves in a quagmire from which there are only *TWO* viable means of escape:\n\n1. Find peace with the Palestinians within the parameters of the post-1948 reality (good luck with that), or\n\n2. Exterminate the Palestinians\n\nThat's it. Those are your only viable options.\n\nI recognize that the first one is essentially impossible, which means that the Zionists chose to exterminate the Palestinians in order to build their country.\n\nThe modern State of Israel is built on the bones of the Palestinian people.\n\nTo say this out loud is to risk being labeled an anti-Semite, as I am all too aware, but I am not an anti-Semite. I also do not deny the right of the Jewish people to establish a nation of their own. I simply believe that modern Zionism made a choice to sacrifice the Palestinians rather than work with them.

The British were leaving and the Arab population was openly at war with them. Who was going to defend the Jews? you? the international community that just 3 years prior allowed 6 million Jews to die in the Holocaust?\n\nYou know, we went to war with the Nazis and defeated them, yeah? (Well, it was mostly the Russians, but the point stands that they were defeated by non-Jews.) Also, we didn\'t know about the Holocaust until after the war, so you\'re trying to say *ex post facto* that the international community allowed the attempted extermination of the Jews when, in fact, no one knew it was anywhere near that bad.\n\nAs to the root of your point:\n\n1. I repeat again that there were already people living in the Levant. The Zionists had a responsibility to those people *because they were already there*. The question of the Zionist\'s own survival (*not* the Jews, let\'s not conflate those separate groups) is sort of moot since they moved back to Palestine of their own accord and later declared independence of their own accord. Generally speaking, if you\'re going to move to a place and live among its inhabitants, you should probably work it out with them ahead of time, yeah?\n\n2. Israel could not exist without the ongoing sustained support of the international community, as evidenced by the fact that you are utterly dependent upon U.S. munitions and defense financing, which you have at least once obtained under duress (in the 1973 Yom Kippur War when the specter of the Samson Option was invoked by the Israeli ambassador to D.C. in order to frighten Nixon into sending supplies).\n\n3. The situation would not have changed a whit if the Palestinians had declared independence, as their claims would have conflicted with your own.\n\n>I don\'t think its impossible. The moment Palestinians renounce their goal of destroying Israel and agree to a 2 state solution like they should\'ve done from the beginning I think the Israeli public will be open to accept it.\n\nAgain you say ""Palestinians"" as if they are a monolith, well, what about Fatah?', ""> You know, we went to war with the Nazis and defeated them, yeah?\n\nYes, but not for the sake of the Jews, only after Germany invaded Poland.\n\n> Also, we didn't know about the Holocaust until after the war, so you're trying to say that the international community allowed the attempted extermination of the Jews ex post facto when, in fact, no one knew it was anywhere near that bad\n\nThe extent was not known but Germany mistreatment of Jews was, and when the international community was called to step up and help them they neglected to do so\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89vian_Conference\n\nThe point is, which you did not address, was that there was no one to defend the Jews at the time and it would be extremely foolish of them to put their lives at the hands of people that wanted them gone.\n\n> I repeat again that there were already people living in the Levant. The Zionists had a responsibility to those people because they were already there.\n\nYou insist on removing any agency from the Palestinians, the power dynamic during that period of time was not the same as today. Both groups were subjects of the British empire and before that the Ottoman empire. They both had equal agency and responsibility. The Zionist  acted responsibly and accepted a 2 state solution and the Palestinians rejected it.\n\n> The question of the Zionist's own survival (not the Jews, let's not conflate those separate groups) is sort of moot since they moved back to Palestine of their own accord\n\nNot sure how you can say the question of their survival was moot considering the context of the time period. They moved back to Palestine on their own accord and the other choice was to stay in Europe and die in the Holocaust or in some Russian pogrom.\n\n> Generally speaking, if you're going to move to a place and live among its inhabitants, you should probably work it out with them ahead of time, yeah?\n\nThat only works if the inhabitants are open to the idea of living side by side in Peace.\n\n> Israel could not exist without the ongoing sustained support of the international community\n\nIrrelevant. I can say the same thing about any other country. Arab states wouldn't be able to support their war on Israel without external support. Either from France and Britain in 1948 or the Soviet Union from then on.\n\nNot to mention the Palestinians themselves are entirely dependant on international Aid, including an entire UN agency that provides them with food, work and education.\n\n> The situation would not have changed a whit if the Palestinians had declared independence, as their claims would have conflicted with your own\n\nThat depends entirely what said claims would be, if they claimed 100% of the land like they did in actual history than yeah it wouldn't change much. Although maybe the war wouldn't end with Gaza and West Bank being under the control of Egypt and Jordan. Which funnily enough would de facto be what the International community (claim they) want.\n\n> what about Fatah?\n\nWhat about them? they share similar goals to Hamas only they are more secular and have better PR."", "">Yes, but not for the sake of the Jews, only after Germany invaded Poland.\n\nNo one was obligated to help the Jews. Whether or not they *should* have helped is a separate discussion.\n\nAs you rightly point out, this is one of the reasons for the formation of the State of Israel -- and in fact, it is one of the main reasons for my own belief that Israel has a right to exist. The Jews needed to have a home and a capacity to defend themselves. So we agree on something else here.\n\nHowever, the Palestinians were displaced in the process of forging that new reality, which cannot simply be ignored. Israel still has to find a way to build its own home while fulfilling its moral obligation to the other people who were living there. Such is the reality of the situation. When the Zionists began moving back to Palestine, the land wasn't empty and there were people with a long and rich history who had grown to call it home. I don't know what to tell you except that those people have a right to be there too. I'm sorry that their existence is inconvenient to the formation of your own state, but what is there to be done about it?\n\n>You insist on removing any agency from the Palestinians, the power dynamic during that period of time was not the same as today. Both groups were subjects of the British empire and before that the Ottoman empire. They both had equal agency and responsibility.

They were told something big was being planned, but that\'s the extent if it. I think it more likely they simply fucked up. What I know for sure is that you have no idea one way or the other. \n\nAnd no matter what or why they did or didn\'t do, the guilt still lies with hamas. It was the cowards of hamas who CHOSE to intentionally target civilians, killing 1400, torturing many, kidnapping hundreds. If hamas shared your concern for the arabs in gaza, why don\'t they release the hostages? You know why, you just can\'t admit it. Just admit it. Admit who you are. Stop lying to yourself.

They can\'t be genocided. Impossible. I see what you do here, comrade - you ""accuse the other side of what you do"". As you well know that the only side that intends to genocide the other is the gazans. It\'s in hamas\' charter. Genocide is hamas\'s stated purpose. \n\nNo liar, Israel isn\'t committing genocide. Israel is preventing gazans from genociding Israelis. \n\nSo, what\'s with the ""Let\'s never forget"" nonsense? Trying to deflect the guilt? Childish wordplay. You make it seem like they ignored a hurricane warning. No, the fault lies with hamas. It was the cowards of hamas who CHOSE to intentionally target civilians. Hamas CHOSE to kill 1400. Hamas CHOSE to torture many. Hamas CHOSE to kidnap hundreds. Let\'s never forget that. Babies. They kidnapped and killed babies. Intentionally. Cowards. These are your friends. This is who you are. \n\nOn Oct7, hamas proved that peace is not possible. So hamas must be gotten rid of, no matter what it costs. There is no other way. Is there? Can you think of any other way? Can you offer any peaceful solution? No, you\'re just here to cry about things that must happen. There is only one path to peace, and it requires dealing with hamas.

Gaza could be a mediterranean paradise, except that it's run by gazans. If there had been a real genocide, there wouldn't be any orphans. Are you not familiar with the hamas member who used one of his victim's phone to call his parents during the massacre? There is a recording of it. He certainly wasn't an orphan. Or the videos of captured hamas members, asked if their parents would approve? They certainly aren't orphans. Liar. \n\nIf there had been a genocide, there would be less gazans. Why is there more? Because there is no genocide. You're just lying again. Repeating lies doesn't help your case, it just exposes the weakness of your argument. And when people notice that you repeatedly lie, they won't believe anything you say. You lie about everything. I guess you have to - the facts aren't on your side, are they? Liar. \n\n>Don't be surprised if more die. F around and Find out.\n\nNow the cowards in gaza get to go up against soldiers with guns - face to face. Let's see how they do. How are they doing so far? Not so good. Yes, they f'd around and now they are finding out. Hamas not so good at fighting soldiers. Not organized enough, not smart enough, and certainly not brave enough.

Your bs talking points, lies, and childish word-games don't change the fact that the terrorists in this situation are hamas. Obviously. It's blatantly obvious. Did you even watch the video? \n\nEven tho what you said is a ridiculous exaggeration, I can see someone thinking like that up until Oct6. I don't know how things will shake out in the long run but if I had to bet, my guess is that the events of Oct7 will result in a massive shift of perspective away from the gazans, and towards the Israelis. I think you've already seen a substantial shift. Notice how not a single arab country is taking gazan refugees? Why is that? Why doesn't Jordan take some refugees? Why doesn't Saudi Arabia? Iraq? Why doesn't Egypt take some? Hell, it's just a short walk to the Sinai. Even the Persians (who likely instigated this) are letting them go it alone. \n\nNo, I think you're wrong. I think you've filled your head with propaganda written before Oct7 and can't accept that things have changed.

None of that really matters though. The Hamas Articles are completely different from the Torah. The Torah was written thousands of years ago and the Hamas Charter was written in 1988.\n\nMy point is that Hamas even more Nazi than the Nazis and Israel is just a government trying to stay in ""the promised land"" and doing whatever they can to prevent Hamas from completing their goal. You say that Israel wants this conflict to happen, but there is plenty of evidence showing Israel attempting to end the conflict. Notably, the ceasefire agreement in 2012 brokered by Egypt:\n\n*1.a. Israel shall stop all hostilities in the Gaza Strip land, sea and air including incursions and targeting of individuals.*\n\n*b. All Palestinian factions shall stop all hostilities from the Gaza Strip against Israel including rocket attacks, and all attacks along the border.*\n\n*c.

If Hamas surrendered, there would be no humanitarian crisis anymore.\n\nThe reality is, Israel and Hamas have completely different goals. Hamas is doing everything they can to achieve their goal but it is not working well because Israel\'s military is infinitely stronger.

It upholds Jihad. How is taking advantage of the vulnerable freedom fighting? How is that not causing more violence and terror and blood shed. And this is coming from someone who has been subject to and is still subject to a dictatorship. \n\nThis dictatorship was tired of the previous government and so they decided to overthrow it in the name of freedom and liberation and giving the people power. Plowing through the vulnerable, murdering all opposition, murdering children and making young boys fight for their cause, trapping everyone in the country, with land mines in the escape routes. \n\nSaid dictatorship turned the country for worse, people went hungry, people went thirsty. Children without arms or legs. Only those who are in power and don‚Äôt oppose them have prospered by stealing from those who are innocent and have worked their backs off to own everything they do.\n\nIs this not what the Hamas support?

Moreover, for that day to come, the Jewish people first have to hold up their side of the contract and establish the Jewish land, otherwise there will be no devine intervention. In the minds of most orthodox people, based on their Thora interpretation, that\'s by pretty much any means necessary. We are talking about Greater Israel (Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema; ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊î◊©◊ú◊û◊î), usually spanning over the entirety of Babylon. Which is in the Bible, too. ***That*** is Likud\'s raison d\'√™tre. Netanyahu\'s voters have very similar goals to Hamas, and they are Israel\'s king makers. Hence why understanding that interpretation is a prerequisite. \n\n> The Torah was written thousands of years ago\n\nThe modern interpretations of that text. The entire conflict is permiated by concepts that stem from the Quran and Thora. That declaration by Hamas is a rehash of the religious Jihad, that\'s the entire claim to legitimaticy. This is so, so important to understanding this subject, massive parts of both sides feel like this conflict was prophesied by their respective religious text and they want to get that ball rolling. In that respect, all abrahemic texts are completly backwards. That\'s what all moderates in this conflict struggle with, +60% of people involved are Absolutists.\n\n>My point is that Hamas even more Nazi than the Nazis\n\nYeah, you are using the same demagoguery used in that Hamas declaration and I am pretty sure you get that. Nazi Germany planned on exterminating the Jewish race, not because Jews tried to conquer their shit, but because of some compeltly obscure conspiracy theroy and bc they figured expulsing them instead would be too much work... The Palestinian resistence, the PLO and Hamas has no (open) extermination plans. They are a reaction to a real group of people coming into their country and claiming large parts of it for themselves, usually with force and their goal is to push them out, through war.\n\nI have no idea why anyone would find that a adequate comparissons. It completly trivializes the conflict and Israel\'s role, something you do pretty consistently. For example, while there was a Ceasefire on 2012, Hamas was not involved in drafting the agreement and any lasting peace deal discussions were directly tied to the demilitarization of Gaza. But I guess Israel somethow thought that would pan out?\n\n>If Israel had the same goal as Hamas, everyone in Gaza would be killed within 20 minutes.\n\nDude, Israel has achieved that. The Palestinian expulsion happened in 1948, over 700 000 Palestinians were removed from the country. Gaza isn\'t proof that there is no cleansing, it\'s a direct result of it. It\'s been a open-air prison, a concentration camp, for half a century, now. The strip has a higher population density than Deli and the median age in Gaza is below 18. That\'s worse than Afghanistan, North Korea, the DR Congo, Nepal, Rwanda, Argentinia... US prisoners, hell, prisoners in China, consistently have more opportunities to change their life. It\'s arguably the largest scale crime against humanity of our generation.\n\nAnd you somehow expect people in Gaza to ""think rationally"" and act like they have some real promise of a future, a life worth living, besides the resistance that their entire identity, their entire Muslim identity, is based on? Like, don\'t get me wrong, the situation is beyond fucked for anyone involved and I do get that, theoretically, the two state solution is a noble goal.. But, fact is, no one in this entire conflict has suffered nearly as much as the Palestinians and even Israelis in the most contested regions have no equal comparisson to that terror.

I don\'t know where you got that from either\n\nI got that from talking to fundamental Christians who absolutely do. Also in the US there are many efforts to force Christian fundamentalism on the population (ie, limiting woman\'s reproductive rights, lgbt bans, etc...). As with all extremists, cherry picking becomes more important the more extreme one gets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>food is used to bring people no matter what the occasion is. Go to literally any event and there\'s a good chance there\'s candy or a giveaway there. Do you condemn all events that lure people with free food then?\n\nIt\'s not about the food - many missionaries force conversions by targeting at risk / in need populations with what they don\'t have. It\'s a form of brain washing\n\nI have no issues with an organization having an open door policy, volunteering in the community when invited to do so, and operating on an attraction policy. Much (not all) missionary work is not like that. All religions have missionary outreach with varying levels of invasiveness which threatens the population that\'s not ""saved.""

Zionism, by definition, is the belief that the Jewish state (Israel) should exist in the Jewish homeland. Anti-Zionism before 1948 meant that you do not believe that a Jewish state should be created and post-1948 it means believing that the Jewish state in the Jewish homeland (now known as Israel) should be destroyed.\n\nAs Martin Luther King Jr. said, anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism, full stop. There's no ambiguity there. Anti-Zionism doesn't mean you have a particular and legitimate criticism of Israeli governmental policy. It means you want to see Israel destroyed.\n\nCriticism of Israeli policy is not in and of itself anti-Semitic. Israel is a democracy, and its own citizens criticize the Israeli government on everything to whether buses should run on the Sabbath to whether taxes are too high. But when the criticism of Israeli policy delegitimizes the Jewish state, demonizes it, or applies a double-standard, that is anti-Semitism."", 'I never said she broke a law that warrants the death penalty, nor did I say or even imply I want her dead.\n\nYou‚Äôre a disgusting apologist for saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just some dumbass who ripped a poster, come on man‚Äù.
