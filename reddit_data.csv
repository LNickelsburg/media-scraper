I made this community to narrow down combat footage of the ground invasion into one area. So many of the Israel-Palestine conflict subs have too many news stories/polarized. I would like to make this sub the hub for finding footage of the ground invasion and the conflict that ensues. Please try not to flood the sub with airstrike videos as they are pretty redundant and every other sub has them already (but some will be allowed as long as they dont drown out other footage). Please post any new footage you find I really appreciate it. Footage of combat related to the region are also allowed now. That means clashes in other countries directly inspired or caused by the Gaza invasion.

Battles outside Gaza and on the sea are allowed.

Apparently HAMAS POV videos are banned on Reddit? I’m not sure what exactly is allowed and what isn’t so not sure how to proceed with that in the sub. Pretty lame if we’re only aloud to post the Israeli POV of the invasion.",23,17i1j0k,11,1698452165.0

Have you?,"For the past decade or so I have typically supported Palestine fighting for it's right to having a homeland. However, I just watched about 30 videos of events that took place today. What I saw was not people fighting for their homeland but people murdering, desecrating corpses innocent people. This is terrorism, plain and simple. In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific. I still think both sides should still strive to find peace but I am not sure if this is even possible after today's acts. Hamas likely will need to be eradicated and eliminated, vile people.

Now that this heinous act has occurred and the true face of militant Islam has been shown it is up to the nonviolent majority of muslims to speak out against these disgusting acts of violence.

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/173wv5d/hamas_is_a_terrorist_org_like_isis_al_qaeda_or/,"Hamas is a TERRORIST org like ISIS, Al Qaeda or Taliban","People are forgetting that Hamas is as much a terrorist organization as ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Taliban

Hamas has actively killed any political rivals such as Fatah as they are not Islamic enough. This is what the Taliban and Daesh do, kill any peaceful political Muslim rival parties and use Fascism to get into and maintain power under the guise of religion. 

This is a catastrophic shortsighted blunder by Hamas, not only are they descending upon Israelis like ISIS style Jihadis, the whole world will see the obvious terror outfit this organization is. Muslims will make themselves more liable by siding with Hamas as they lack the nuance to see Palestine without a terrorist organization like Hamas being it's representative.

Most are too politically naive to realize that you don't poke a bear you can't fight. These guys have a few rockets and Iran backing them for their own nefarious political gains, that don't even align with the Palestinians long term safety in mind. You really think you can yell Allahu Akbar and take on the Israeli or US militaries. Do you want them to carpet bomb you? Hamas is being as suicidal and as unplanned as you'd expect from typical inbred Jihadis. 

This has never been a simple battle between Palestine and Israel. Israel is a strategic country, almost like a forward operating Base and it's existence will be maintained no matter what by western nations for their control in the middle east. Are Muslims this politically naive? Look at social media right now 

You don't mess with Nuclear armed nations. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened barely 70 years ago.

Edit: For reference I'm an ex Muslim from Pakistan who grew up supporting Palestine his whole life only to realize that Hamas and Palestine is just a front for Jihadis",1567,173wv5d,822,1696870696.0
israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/nb3trt/both_sides_are_being_mislead_of_the_full_truth/,Both sides are being mislead of the full truth,"So this is my compilation of how this whole thing started, after a lot of research from both sides, since each was holding back information and using it to instigate hate towards the opposite group

So first the prime minister was facing elections and most of the people who would vote for him are Jews, he wanted to get on their good side so he broke peace treaties that allowed housing of Palestinians in Jerusalem after the war took away their property and they had nowhere to live 

Extremist Jews jumped on the opportunity because they believe that Israel is theirs and needs to be populated by only Jews, and for years they have been settling places on the borders of the country to try and claim ""there are too many Jews here for it not to be considered our land and we outnumber Arabs so they should be kicked out"" 

It caused a court case that lasted a while, both sides providing proof that it is their property from many years ago, and it was supposed to continue and be held on Jerusalem day 

That same week happened to be also Ramadan which is a holy time for Muslims and they may or may not be agitated at this time of the year, also because Jews celebrate them being kicked out of their land years ago and they started a riot in the Al Aqsa mosque

At that time it was under renovations and there were rocks lying around, it is unknown where they got fireworks and liquid fuel, maybe to celebrate Ramadan? But people assumed they organized it all 

The crowd was riled up partially by the housing situation, because it meant something deeper about them not feeling safe to live anywhere and that their documents that show it's their housing is suddenly meaningless and is being taken away as if they don't matter at all, just because of some racist people

The crowd started throwing rocks as they got riled up, at the police and some over the wall, trying to target Jews on the other side too? 
The police tried calming everyone down, didn't allow access to the Jews into the wall area, while trying to disarm the situation multiple times before needing to resort to more extreme measures 

They used rubber bullets and tear grenades to subdue the people to keep everyone from attacking each other 
The crowd that was throwing stones and fireworks at the police scattered in fear and some ran into the Al Aqsa mosque

People were praying at the mosque at the time and didn't know what was going on, especially because it was a holy time for them

The ones throwing rocks kept throwing them at the police from inside the mosque, and as the police was trying to continue to calm down the situation, the people praying were told that the police was trying to take over the mosque and were hiding in fear in it, some retaliating, and as the police didn't know who was who they used means that won't permeantly damage to contain the situation, such as using tear grenades

The following morning was Jerusalem day and the parade that usually takes occur on this day to represent the victory of Jews winning the war over the Arabs wasn't cancelled, and instead was held with enthusiasm, which riled up the Arabs even more given the circumstances.

Chamas then started shooting rockets at Israel at random, most of them were disarms by the iron dome, but it didn't get them all, and there were a few casualties. 

Also the Arabs riled in the streets, throwing rocks at cars and trying to forcefully beat up people in their car and pull them out, the car driver panicked and accidentally ran into a person on the sidewalk, but he was ok as he stood up, the agression was extreme and luckily the police arrived shortly after to disarm the situation

By this point, the Israeli defense force was taking measures to destroy the locations in which the rocket were shot from which the terrorists decided should be public civilian places such as schools and mosqes and hospitals, there by in order to disarm them there were casualties in lives of citizens and children 22 adults, 9 of which were children

The chamas kept retaliating and shooting about 200 more missiles at Israel in random, some actually hit places like tel Aviv and caused major damages and and injuries and some deaths in total 

Because the defences of Israel against rockets are great, there were less casualties on the Israeli side of the conflict, as they tried disarming the Palestinian sources of the missiles, and because they chose places that are public, innocent civilian suffered the consequences. 

And that spread all over the news outside of Israel and people were mad because they thought we knew there were children in there and we killed them anyway, but from the information we had, some terrorist leaders were in there, and because it's so difficult to know where they are they chose to act fast, people believe that netanyahu is in support of this due to his bias against Palestinians

This is documented from observing both sides of the story as of 12:30 pm may 12 2021, both sides didn't give all the information that occured and after some research this made more sense. There may be new information after this documented time period which isn't included.

I would like people to know the truth, I hate that hate is being spread by people with motives towards the opposing groups and it's costing lives on both sides just because of a spread if misinformation.",1329,nb3trt,645,1620865669.0

I’ve received the most nightmarish scenario :

my best friend was in a nature party when they heard the missile alarms, they ran to their cars to flee and terrorists waited for them on the highway, it was a trap. 
A friend was in the vehicle with him, he said they got to the car and tried to flee, saw dozens of bodies lying in the floor, they went past a burnt car when a terrorist started spraying at them. The driver friend got shot in the arm, my best friend got shot in the head and begged for help that didn’t come in time, the friend who survived tried to resuscitate him to no avail, he suffered for three hours barely conscious begging to be saved until he died. The army eventually came and evacuated the driver friend. He now has to live with his best friend dying in his arms whilst tripping on psychedelics, being unable to help.

I was an israeli soldier , armored corps, and few days ago..I just found out that a kibutz I was entrusted with protecting for 1.5 years ( kibutz is kind of a village) been slaughtered, you know the story .
I cant bring myself to sleep, to stop crying, I feel just...lost, they were not part of any war , they were just people living their life .

So I see people standing with Gaza , let me set things straight.
You don't stand with Gaza, you stand with Hammas , they dont just slaughter my people, they slaughter their own , they are playing with lives for the sake of publicity , forcing people to stay in their homes after we told them to evacuate , so they could show atrocities all over the news, they force families to stay and die brutally in their homes .

And then I see LGBTQ standing with them...and thats i gotta say, just crazy.
I mean , CRAZY, if those people were to visit Gaza they would be slaughtered and their bodies would hang over the city walls as a reminder of what happens to people who thinks to be openly gay .

We are facing evil , evil that isnt scared to die, isnt scared that his people will die, it only wants one thing..that we suffer, even if they have nothing at the end, and there is no one , they just want to kill.
Every money israel ever gave them to actually build their city and care for their people, they took to fund bombs and weapons , and I am not just standing against them as an Israeli, I stand against them as a human , because this thing right here is the kind of s**t that will annihilate human race .

They got in this country, and they took an israeli Muslim male nurse, they heard him praying for his life in arabic, and they shot him in his chest nonetheless, cuff him and started running with him , he survived , he told the news that he recalled them saying in arabic "" good , now we have israeli hostage, they wont attack us from the air now"".

We fight them as humans , no muslim, no jew, no christian, left , right , straight , gay .

Only Humans .
Please , stop feeding into Hammas fake news, thats whats making them stronger, and stay united so those people crying for their lives while dying, while there is no one...no one to save them , will be the last.",1069,176ttyf,1913,1697185195.0

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1749ufc/as_a_palestinianamerican_i_am_disturbed_on_many/,As a Palestinian-American I am disturbed on many levels,"As background, I am a Palestinian-American born and raised in the US. I am pro-Palestinian and consider myself fairly well-read and pragmatic on the conflict. In following for the past two decades since my teens, this is perhaps the most disturbed I've felt and I think it has to do with the scale. A few points:

1) Hamas committed a terrible tragedy. This was a massacre of civilians. I feel for the Israelis who lost loved ones and others held captive. Seeing the body count of Israeli civilians climbing was like a continuing punch in the gut. I always knew Hamas was ruthless, and did not see them capable of caring this out on such a horrendous scale.

2) For every Israeli civilian killed, I know there will be 10 civilians in Gaza killed by the end of this. Israel has no choice but to respond in great force. This will be on the largest scale Gaza has ever seen. The sinking feeling of seeing the Israeli civilian deaths is now paired with the anxiety of the coming destruction in Gaza.

3) I knew there were no prospects going forward in the conflict. This will just further cement things. The far-right on both sides will be strengthened. This is a gift for Netanyahu who will stay in power. Hamas know Israel will respond in great force, and doesn't care because it furthers their cause of blaming Israel. Both sides are abhorrent.

4) Moderates on both sides will be pushed to the right by the end of this. Israelis are rightfully horrified about the massacre and murder committed by Hamas but will blame the Palestinians as a whole for complacency/support of Hamas. Palestinians continue to be brutalized by the occupation and will become increasingly desperate and resentful of Israelis, especially in Gaza. I see the occupation only getting worse going forward.

5) The next generation of Palestinians will be just as resentful and more prone to Hamas-like propaganda blaming Israel for everything. Whatever happens will die down eventually and just repeatedly boil over into rounds of violence.

6) Regarding the current dialogue: I am frustrated by those who are uninformed about the conflict blaming Palestinians/Muslims for everything with really no understanding of the last 50 years of occupation. I am also equally frustrated with the Arabic/Muslim community in my circles that in my opinion have not been strong enough in condemning the violence against Israel.

&#x200B;

Today we saw what ""Free Palestine"" and ""From the River to the Sea"" really means.

&#x200B;

* Palestinians murdered, kidnapped, and raped innocent Jews on a holiday, 50 years to the date of the Yom Kippur War.
* Palestinians murdered 400 Jews and counting.
* Palestinians  raped, mutilated and paraded with the naked body of a Jewish woman that they murdered as if she was a trophy.
* Palestinians anally raped a teenage Jewish girl and kidnapped her to Gaza.
* Palestinians murdered seniors who were merely sitting at a bus stop.
* Palestinians kidnapped children who they will likely torture and murder.
* Palestinians are beheaded Jewish soldiers in the streets.
* Palestinians are stopped vehicles and slit the throats of the people in them.
* Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Palestinians around the world, such as in New York, London and Berlin, are celebrating the massacre of Jews today.
* Some of the images and videos we are seeing of Palestinians are similar to the works of other jihadis such as IS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban.

&#x200B;

If your takeaway from the massacre of 300 Jews is that the world has ignored the issue of a Palestinian state or some whataboutism, you are NOT a human rights advocate - YOU ARE AN ANTISEMITIC BIGOT. There is no justification for murder of innocent Jewish civilians. Land is not an excuse to pillage, rape, kidnap and murder,  especially when it wasn't their land to claim.

&#x200B;

The Palestinian cause has remained unevolved for 100 years and is an Antisemitic death cult, calling for the genocide of Jews. The irony is that Palestinian supporters scream cease-fire when Israel has to address the terrorism in Gaza but they will never condemn the rape, kidnapping and murder of innocent Jews which led to it.

&#x200B;

The 2 state solution is dead. The 1 state solution is dead.  You can thank Hamas, who was willfully elected by an overwhelming majority of Palestinians. Palestinians and their supporters have proved that they are not legitimate peace partners and at any opportunity, if they are not excusing the murder of innocent Jews, they are celebrating and/or partaking in it.

Eden was advised to not leave her hotel room out of fears of her safety from a mob of 10,000 people protesting her participation. We all know what the lynch mob would do to her if they could.

Attacking Eden will not bring about a ceasefire nor will it bring a two-state solution. The only thing it achieves is stroking more hostility.

10,000 Pro Palestinians marched through streets of Malmo Sweden on Thursday to chants of “Free Palestine” and “Israel is a terror state.” Banners accused Eurovision of being complicit in genocide and called for a boycott of the competition. Greta Thunberg was present wearing a keffiyah, popularized by mass murdering terrorist Yasser Arafat. Protestors assaulted police.

Not only  is the mob bullying Eden but also fellow Eurovision contestants filled with hate. Last year's Eurovision second-place finisher, Finland's Käärijä (aka the ""Cha Cha Cha"" guy), filmed a dance video clip earlier today with Eden Golan, and then publicly apologized for doing so and said it was not an endorsement. Greece's participant 37-year old Marina Satti pretended to sleep while Eden was being interviewed.Netherlands' participant Joost Klein covered his face with a flag in a sign of disrespect to Eden. He was later banned from the contest for assaulting someone.  Ireland's participant Bambie Thug said her and her team cried that Israel made it to the finals.

At some point, Pro-Palestinians need to see Jews and Israelis as people, not subhumans who deserve to be attacked and murdered. As long as you continue to justify rape, kidnapping and murder, you will not make lives better for anyone.

Eden Golan is only 20 years old, with dreams and aspirations like all of us. She has been singing from a young age and has dreamed her whole life of joining this contest, only to be met with bullying and hate.

War is horrible. Both sides are suffering. As an Israeli, I can say that we want peace. I hope one day that Palestinians and their supporters will realize the only way to achieve peace is accepting that 7 million Jews live in Israel and we are not going anywhere. The way to move forward is to choose coexistence because clearly violence and bullying is not working. Constantly attacking Jews then crying victim when we defend ourselves is not working. It's a cycle of violence that requires serious introspection and cultural change.

For all you Antisemites calling for Israel's destruction, this is not the 1930s and 1940s. Jews and Israel will never be stopped again.

Before Gaza was attacked, but on the day of the murders, most large cities in the Muslim world displayed some type of solidarity with the Palestinians. So they had time to condemn the violence and Hamas but they didn’t.

1993: Israel recognizes the sovereignty of the Palestinian Authority over the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Oslo Accords. Yasser Arafat uses it to support terrorism.  
2000: Israel offers Yasser Arafat recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital. Arafat rejects it and launches the Second Intifada.  
2005: Israel pulls out of the Gaza Strip, dismantles all its settlements, and forces Jews to leave their homes. Palestinians respond by electing Hamas who turn it into a terror state.  
2008: Israel offers Mahmoud Abbas once again recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital and even offered to dismantle all their settlements. And once again, the Palestinians reject it.  
2010-2021: Hamas launches periodic rocket attacks against the state of Israel and builds terror tunnels in order to kidnap and murder Jews while using the people of Gaza as human shields against the IDF.  
2023: Hamas commits the worst act of mass murder against Jews since the Holocaust.

I am genuinely horrified by this. That almost ALL of the voices I used to agree with have all come to agree that any news that describes Hamas in a negative light, or depicts Israel as anything less than the third reich, is only further evidence of how evil Israel is with it shameless propaganda. I do not know how anyone could have seen footage from Oct 7 and think Hamas needs to retain power in Gaza, or that anything they say can be taken good faith.  Whatever anyone thinks about Israel, I cannot believe how people have managed to convince themselves that Hamas must be good guys who have no responsibility whatsoever in the dire situation their civilians are in right now.

Nothing more, nothing less.

I have heard too many people at this point saying that “the problem isn’t Jews, it’s Zionists.” 

First of all, 6 out of the ~15 million Jews (one of them being my father) are Israeli, and would very much like it for their country to exist. Outside of that, most diaspora Jews care about Israel existing because we know the history of persecution against our people and want Israel to exist not only for religious reasons, but also as a sanctuary for all Jews. Half of the Israeli population are descendants of Jewish refugees from all Arab countries, and just in the ’90s Israel had to and was able to let in 1 million former-Soviet Jewish refugees.

OF COURSE there are non-jews who are antisemitic and use Zionism as a cover for Islamophobia.

OF COURSE there are a few crazy Jewish settlers that continue to steak Palestinians homes deep in the West Bank

OF COURSE the Neturei Karta exist, but they are the minority and the vast majority of Jews are still Zionists.

My point is that just because there are Zionist extremists doesn’t mean that most Zionists are extremists, and that just because there are non-Zionist Jews doesn’t mean that Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism.

I am Jewish and Zionist. I don’t support Bibi’s government or his policies. I don’t hate Palestinians for existing or for wanting a state. But none of those stop any of the others from being true.",585,17xnsjh,1729,1700251661.0

The mostly liberal view that if we all just loved each other more everything would be fine is so naive. They do not understand that Hamas does not exist because people in Gaza are oppressed, it exists because since it’s inception almost every country in the region has tried to destroy Israel. Terrorism has nothing to do with poverty or oppression. Osama bin laden was very wealthy. Most of the leaders of Hamas are also very wealthy. 

The majority of people who post that stupid slogan are virtue signalling fools with no understanding of the conflict. If you do not defeat Hamas more Jews will die. They will exert revenge on Israel for this attack. You cannot simply show the people in Gaza more compassion and expect Hamas to give up. It’s such a bad argument. 

Israel should respect the human rights of people in Gaza but they need to defeat Hamas if they want to survive as a nation. As far as I can tell the only way to do this is by invading the territory.

Excerpts from [the NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/world/middleeast/oct-7-attacks-hamas-israel-sexual-violence.html) from 12/28/2023, lightly edited for continuity. \[[Archive link](https://archive.is/aFPBa)\]

**Warning - VERY GRAPHIC descriptions:**

* A two-month investigation by The Times uncovered painful new details, establishing that the attacks against women **were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence on Oct. 7.**
* In a grainy video, you can see her, lying on her back, dress torn, legs spread, vagina exposed. Her face is burned beyond recognition and her right hand covers her eyes....Based largely on the video evidence — which was verified by The New York Times — Israeli police officials said they believed that Ms. \[Gal\] Abdush was raped, and she has become a symbol of the horrors visited upon Israeli women and girls during the Oct. 7 attacks. EDIT - [this is the video](https://www.hamas-massacre.net/content/woman-who-was-raped-and-burned-to-death) they mention - NSFW.
* The Times viewed photographs of one woman’s corpse that emergency responders discovered in the rubble of a besieged kibbutz with dozens of nails driven into her thighs and groin.
* Sapir, a 24-year-old accountant, has become one of the Israeli police’s key witnesses. In a two-hour interview outside a cafe in southern Israel, she recounted seeing groups of heavily armed gunmen rape and kill at least five women...at 8 a.m. on Oct. 7, she was hiding under the low branches of a bushy tamarisk tree, just off Route 232, about four miles southwest of the party. She had been shot in the back...felt faint...covered herself in dry grass and lay as still as she could. About 15 meters from her hiding place she saw motorcycles, cars and trucks pulling up. She saw about 100 men, most of them dressed in military fatigues and combat boots, a few in dark sweatsuits, getting in and out of the vehicles. The men congregated along the road and passed between them assault rifles, grenades, small missiles — and badly wounded women. “It was like an assembly point.” **The first victim she saw** was a young woman with copper-color hair, blood running down her back, pants pushed down to her knees. One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back....While one terrorist raped her, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast.....“One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,”....the men sliced her face and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same time, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three more women....Yura Karol, a 22-year-old security consultant, said he was hiding in the same spot, and he can be seen in one of Sapir’s photos.... In an interview, Mr. Karol said he barely lifted his head to look at the road but he also described seeing a woman raped and killed.
* Raz Cohen....saw five men, wearing civilian clothes, all carrying knives and one carrying a hammer, dragging a woman across the ground. She was young, naked and screaming. “They all gather around her,” Mr. Cohen said. “She’s standing up. They start raping her. I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words.” “Then one of them raises a knife,” he said, “and they just slaughtered her.” Shoam Gueta, one of Mr. Cohen’s friends and a fashion designer, said the two were hiding together in the streambed. He said he saw at least four men step out of the van and attack the woman, who ended up “between their legs.” He said that they were “talking, giggling and shouting,” and that one of them stabbed her with a knife repeatedly, “literally butchering her.”
* Yinon Rivlin, a member of the rave’s production team who lost two brothers in the attacks, said that after hiding from the killers, he emerged from a ditch and made his way to the parking area, east of the party, along Route 232, looking for survivors. Near the highway, he said, he found the body of a young woman, on her stomach, no pants or underwear, legs spread apart. He said her vagina area appeared to have been sliced open, “as if someone tore her apart.”
* Captain Maayan asked to be identified only by her rank and surname because of the sensitivity of the subject. She said she had seen several bodies with cuts in their vaginas and underwear soaked in blood and one whose fingernails had been pulled out.
* **There are at least three women and one man who were sexually assaulted and survived**, according to Gil Horev, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. “None of them has been willing to come physically for treatment,” he said. Two therapists said they were working with a woman who was gang raped at the rave and was in no condition to talk to investigators or reporters.",500,18t3q2y,1178,1703795491.0

Imagine having to run on foot with a baby on your arms, dodging bullets, crying and begging for your life and praying to god.

Can't?

Thats ok. It a hard thing to imagine.

But that was our reality that black Saturday, the October 7th.

They took our kids. They took our infant babies. They took our moms, fathers, and grandparents. They took them to Gaza, and the rest, they killed and raped, not necessarily in that order. They burned homes, killed babies in their cribs, shot families in their living rooms one by one, so the others could see. They erased WHOLE FAMILIES, and then they burned their bodies. That made the identification process much harder so some of the family members who did manage to survive, still waiting to know TO THIS DAY, the 8th day of the war, if their family or friends are somehow alive in Gaza or found dead in their home garden.

They don't know what to hope for.

They massacred a music fest party of our young, and they raped and burned whoever they could. Killed hundreds of young folks who only wished to dance and spread love. The party was protected by some officers, but Hamas was so many, not even one officer was left alive.

Some people hid in the bushes for the whole day, without food and water, scared to their teeth.

Some of these people hid in bonkers for the whole day, terrified. Some were discovered hiding in clothes closets, taken and shot, or worse. the others tried to keep their kids and babies quiet while they hear how all the people they ever knew are massacred outside their safe-room window. You feel hopeless. You say your goodbyes. you prepare for the worst.

THOSE ACT ARE NOT HUMAN.All they want is to kill and destroy, and they use whatever means they have, even on the account of their **own families and children**, who they teach to hate from a very young age.

At least 1,400 dead to this day and we haven't collected/counted al the bodies yet.

They’ve singlehandedly manufactured support for the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria, & Hamas in Gaza. Now, they’re silencing Iranians by either telling people to celebrate the Islamic Republic’s attack, or stating that it was “self-defense.”

Of course, this propaganda is first spread by paid lobbyists for the Islamic Republic & its allies. But Palestinians & their supporters then actively spread this messaging at an alarming rate, to the point where it becomes impossible to stop. 

No matter how many times I speak about this or tell people to stop, they don’t care. Because they’ve made it perfectly clear that they only want to speak when they believe the West is at fault, and they align with the anti-American and anti-imperialist soft power propaganda of the Islamic Republic. 

When they say “by any means necessary,” they mean it. Because they would let every last middle eastern person get killed & the region be destroyed, so long as Palestine is “free.” 

I believe that the pro-Palestinian movement could be a rightful cause. But its loudest voices are either bad actors or useful idiots, & until this changes, nothing else will.

The arrogance of this community is really something else. They will continually victimize themselves and speak about oppression, while simultaneously standing on the necks of others. 

They lecture you about “resistance,” but they’re silent when Iranian women, men, and youth rise up against tyrants & theocratics. I don’t think they know what resistance means.

I do not feel comfortable sharing my thoughts with any of my Jewish friends and family. I wanted to post this in the r/Judaism thread but they prohibit Israel/Palestine content so this seems like the next best place. 

I’ll try to be as brief as possible, so some nuance may be lost for the sake of brevity. I feel alienated by the American Jewish community for my thoughts on the recent violence in Israel/Palestine. These are my thoughts: 1) I condemn Hamas’ war crimes against Israelis. 2) I condemn the Israeli government’s war crimes against Palestinians. 3) I mourn for the innocent lives lost of all nationalities in the past days. I am absolutely flabbergasted that saying these 3 things simultaneously is considered controversial— to me all of these things should be patently obvious and non-controversial. Yet if I shared these views on social media, my Jewish friends and family would be furious at me for mentioning Israeli and Hamas war crimes in the same breath and call me a self-hating Jew who believes Israelis deserved to die. They would attack me for mentioning both Israeli and Palestinian victims, because it implies that Israel is equally as bad as Hamas. 

Acknowledging the historical impacts of the West Bank occupation and Gaza siege is not equivalent to saying that “Israeli victims deserved to die”. Multiple things can be true at once: Hamas is directly responsible for its war crimes AND anti-Palestinian Israeli policies over the past decades created a powder keg ready to erupt in Gaza. I believe it’s important to recognize the full context of the violence, especially when thinking about how further violence can be prevented in the future. I’ve seen several Israeli commentators state this same sentiment in recent articles.

Basically I feel like a crazy person for simply mourning for both Israelis and Palestinians and acknowledging basic historical realities. I know I’ll probably get hate comments here as well because that’s how it goes. But please just know that I come from a place of good faith— I am genuinely devastated by the recent deaths of civilians and only wish that I could honestly discuss where to go from here with fellow Jews without being verbally attacked.

""A censorship board composed of five Cabinet members prohibited former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin from including in his memoirs a first‐person account of the expulsion of 50,000 Palestinian civilians from their homes near Tel Aviv during the 1948 Arab‐Israeli war.""

“Psychologically, this was one of the most difficult actions we undertook. The population of Lod did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the 10 to 15 miles to the point where they met up with the legion."" - Yitzhak Rabin

In “0 Jerusalem,” Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre described “a calculated Israeli policy” to drive Arab residents from their homes, and they confirmed reports by some survivors that many elderly people and small children died in the overpowering heat during the forced march.

""Contingents of the extremist Stern gang and Irgun attacked the village and lined men, women and children up against walls and shot them, according to Red Cross and British documentation.""

""A major expulsion took place at Qisarya, south of Haifa, where Palestinian Arabs were evicted and their houses destroyed on 19–20 February 1948. In attacks that were not authorised in advance, several communities were expelled by the Haganah and several others were chased away by the Irgun."""" - Benny Morris

""During the ""long seminar"", a meeting of Ben-Gurion with his chief advisors in January 1948, the main point was that it was desirable to ""transfer"" as many Arabs as possible out of Jewish territory, and the discussion focussed mainly on the implementation...Plan Dalet was the master plan for the expulsion of the Palestinians."" - Ilan Pappe

According to Morris, ""The Haganah mortar attacks of 21–22 April [on Haifa] were primarily designed to break Arab morale in order to bring about a swift collapse of resistance and speedy surrender. [...] But clearly the offensive, and especially the mortaring, precipitated the exodus. The three-inch mortars ""opened up on the market square [where there was] a great crowd [...] a great panic took hold. The multitude burst into the port, pushed aside the policemen, charged the boats and began to flee the town"", as the official Haganah history later put it"". According to Pappé, this mortar barrage was deliberately aimed at civilians to precipitate their flight from Haifa.

""The orders of Carmeli's 22nd Battalion were ""to kill every Arab encountered"" and to set alight with fire-bombs ""all objectives that can be set alight.""

Israeli vans with loudspeakers drove through the streets ordering all the inhabitants to evacuate immediately, and such as were reluctant to leave were forcibly ejected from their homes by the triumphant Israelis whose policy was now openly one of clearing out all the Arab civil population before them... From the surrounding villages and hamlets, during the next two or three days, all the inhabitants were uprooted and set off on the road to Ramallah... No longer was there any ""reasonable persuasion"". Bluntly, the Arab inhabitants were ejected and forced to flee into Arab territory... Wherever the Israeli troops advanced into Arab country the Arab population was bulldozed out in front of them.",433,nxn8du,797,1623437274.0

The move was hailed by the United Nations in light of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, whose sole power plant has been rationing fuel and cutting electricity service to the beleaguered enclave.

While the crossings were opened, terrorists in the Strip launched a large mortar barrage across the border, reportedly firing dozens of shells throughout the area, including at Kerem Shalom and Erez.

As a result, a 19-year-old soldier was hurt by mortar fire while assisting in transfer of aid at Gaza crossing. Israel has closed the reopened passages again following the attack.

I was born in israel, so did my father, so did his father, so did his father and so did his father.
We don't know past that, but it likely goes back further, back to the days of the ottomen empire.
On my mother side, my grandparents were born in persia, modern day Iran, and had to flee because they were jewish.

I don't understand how someone can tell me I deserve to die for wanting to live here.
People keep telling me israel is america's doggy, and we steal US aid, but US aid accounts for less than 3% of israel's annual GDP.
People keep telling me that israel is an apartheid state, while I can't get accepted to medical school and they can with no SAT or even a high school diploma, while I need an almost perfect score on both.
They also get scholarships I can't get and more advanced healthcare than I get for free.

Most israeli arabs I see drive mercedes or skoda cars and wear luxury watches.

How can people tell me that I am an opressor? A colonizer?

It's driving me crazy that just because I was born here I am destined to be hated by the world.

Yeah israel is not perfect, and you cannot 100% justify what we are doing in gaza, but you also can't say there is no reason and that it's blindless genocide, because it is not.
There is a pretty famous recording from october 7th, where a hamas member calls his father and excitedly tells him he killed 10 jews. The israelis framed this as a horrific war crime and as something unspeakable, which it is.
Sadly, a few weeks later, I heard from an IDF soldier who was in gaza: Damn I shot a dude that's cool, maybe killed him.

This is not acceptable from both sides.
War is not fun. War is not wanted.
I don't know a single person who wanted this war to start.

It's just.. really frustrating that I am no longer allowed to talk in my language abroad without getting beaten, or talk about my country proudly online.
I can't even mention where I am from when talking online or I will get death threats and chants.

People tell me to go to new york, why?
I have never been in new york, I don't have family in new york, I'm not connected to new york, I don't have a visa, or a green card, or an esta.

- “Where should the Israelis go”

- “what do you mean? What about the the Palestinians that were displaced where should they go?”

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18uy4di/as_a_muslim_woman_i_support_israels_right_to/,As a Muslim woman I support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish State.,"Here are the reasons why. 

1.) Israel is the indigenous homeland of the Jewish People. The Jewish people have existed in that land for 3000 years. You will find Jewish graves from that time period, Jewish artifacts in the ground. The cities that exist are all Jewish names. Israel lives  and breathes Jewish History. 

2.) Judaism was the first Abrahamic religion they just want to mind their own business in their little land, they don’t proselytize and are not interested and were never interested in conquering or converting anyone. They just want to live in peace. 

3.) Jewish people have always wanted to go back to their homeland. They have been expelled from it by many empires, had their temples destroyed. Yet they kept up this hope for 2000 years. Every Passover they would say “ Next Year In Jerusalem” 

4.) Jewish people have been massacred and prosecuted in every single diaspora community they have lived in for simply being Jewish. There is no other community in the history of humanity that has been prosecuted for their religion like the Jews have. 

5.) Jewish people are resilient they went through so much trauma and have found ways to survive. I admire them as a Muslim woman because I can understand being confronted with so much bigotry and barriers against you. 

6.) Jewish people are progressive and they support many progressive movements such as the civil rights movement, women’s rights movement, they also stand up for other minorities who are being prosecuted for their religion and their ethnicity. 

7.) Jewish people have helped me. When I emigrated to the US as a refugee. Jewish American organizations helped me with clothes, resources. I also have a lot of Jewish friends and co-workers who are the one of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met. 

8.) Israel is a country and just like every other country they make mistakes. We can criticize the policies of Israel and not wish for Israel’s destruction. Muslims and Arabs have killed way more Muslims/ Arabs than Israel ever has. No one has ever wanted to wipe Syria or Iraq off the map for the actions of those governments but everyone wants to wipe Israel off the map. 

9.) if Israel ceases to exist this will put Jews worldwide in danger. Everyone dislikes Jews and wants to murder them. Israel is essential for Jewish safety. 

10.) Israel tries to make peace with its neighbors. Since the inception of Israel they have tried to have a seat at the table with its neighbors but they have all tried destroying Israel. 

To conclude this post, Israel and the Jewish people are not the monsters they are made out to be. They are humans just like us and they make mistakes but denying their right to exist in their homeland is cruel knowing their history.",407,18uy4di,196,1703993174.0

A muslim (+ hijabi!) writer, and liberal/peace activist from Egypt. She dared to speak on what she saw on October 7th. She called it what it is; a horrific terrorist attack. She said Israel had the right to defend itself and understandably cannot stop until Hamas is no longer a threat. 

She was called a Zionist, a Traitor, and everyone in Egypt wanted her persecuted for high treason, the punishment of which is life in prison. All this, for a mere statement. For putting what she saw into words without eliminating or editing anything. This is largely why there is no opposition in the Arab world, you either believe and parrot the common narrative, or you’re an enemy of the state. Imprisoned or killed.

I myself have experienced similar situations, even on this sub where people question my origins and call me a liar for saying I am of Palestinian descent. They have no idea that people like me exist, because we are consistently silenced and shunned. It is an unforgivable sin to speak against “your people” . And while “the other side” clearly has living, breathing opposition that doesn’t shy away from criticizing every aspect of their government and their policies, which only adds to the depth and richness of this side’s experience, there’s a clear lack of such richness of opinion on our side. Not only that, but “my side” uses the “other side’s” opposition against them! While they shut down anyone who dares to speak against their policies 🤦🏻‍♀️

I urge people to see what precisely happened in Israel by going to Hamas-massacre.net, and also view the way Hamas portrays what occurred by going to Hamas.com and see for themselves. Ask yourself how your country would have responded to such a savage and deplorable attack on civilians. 

It is absurd to suggest that any Western country would have responded differently than Israel since that day. Unless any other country or coalition of countries would like to put boots on the ground to guarantee security to Israel, then any criticism of Israel’s response is just words with no meaning. Of course Israel will take the opinions of its allies into consideration, but at the end of the day Israel is going to do what it needs to do to protect its civilians. 

The war is against Hamas not against Palestinians, and the numbers support it. Israel has dropped over 29,000 bombs on Gaza, and around 30,000 Palestinians have been killed. Anyone who knows how easy it is to kill people with bombs would realize that an almost 1:1 ratio of bombs to death is extremely targeted ammunitions regardless of the fact that Hamas has deeply embedded itself within civilian populations. 

Any assertion that Israel is targeting civilians is a gross misrepresentation of what is going on in the war. Rather than pressuring Israel to come to a ceasefire, countries should pressure Hamas to release all the hostages and lay down its arms.",407,1bjj1z3,1321,1710955593.0

Let me be clear I am absolutely SICK to my stomach about what Hamas have done to the Israelis. But that aside I wanna once again talk about Hamas’s impact on the Palestinians. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again: we don’t know how many people in Gaza ACTUALLY support Hamas because they’re documented to execute critics and political rivals. I wish video posts were allowed here because I saw a video of a mother in Gaza who lost her children calling Hamas dogs and three men were holding her that appeared to be her family members. They quickly put their hands on her mouth and told her to be quiet and BBC had to blur her face. They didn’t blur anyone else’s faces. You wanna know why? Because if Hamas were to find out who she was they’d BRUTALLY torture and execute her. And that’s what’s so frustrating about the worldwide Hamas support. Even if you support Palestinians, let me be ABSOLUTELY AND ABUNDANTLY CLEAR: HAMAS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR OWN CIVILIANS. Hamas officials have just admitted they don’t believe Gazan civilians are their responsibility and so they built shelters for their COWARDLY selves but not their people AND they added fuel to the fire in the midsts of THEIR PEOPLE BEING KILLED by stating that they’ll keep repeating October 7th until “israel is destroyed” and that everything they do is “justified”. I speak Arabic so I can confirm the translations were accurate. Hamas have a selfish goal of Islamic world domination in which they will be the leaders. Destruction of Israel is only step one for them. Tone deaf and brainwashed Palestinians and their supporters outside Gaza champion and make excuses for Hamas from their places of privilege without having any regard for how AWFUL Hamas have been for their own people.Especially when non Palestinians try to defend Hamas. As a Palestinian this all makes me ANGRY! Hamas did these attacks knowing Israel would strike back with great force and they prepared themselves for it but not the “people they’re fighting for”. I understand why Israel want to eradicate Hamas although I wish they were more calculated because it’s simply wrong to kill 400 Palestinian civilians just to target one Hamas member (the refugee camp). I feel like we should all agree on that. I want Hamas gone and I know they use their people as human shields but Israel could do more to minimize civilian casualties. In any case Hamas need to be eradicated for the sake of ALL of humanity, Israelis, Jews, Palestinians, and the world. 

Edit: Let me also add they used all the money and resources donated to their people to build weapons and live in mansions, fly private jets, eat good, and rent expensive hotels outside of Palestine while their people starve. They are the definition of selfish.

I often see comments along the lines, ""The Palestinians saved you people from the Holocaust, accepted you into their land, and you betrayed them."" Like, what? In fact, my brother also told me this the other day. Where did you get this history lesson from? I hear this kind of saintly polishing of Palestinian history a lot. So... we ran some humanitarian effort to save the Jews from the Holocaust? Lol. I saved several screenshots of such comments, but unfortunately, image attachments aren't enabled in this sub.
 

A foreign power ruled over our people (Britain) and forced mass immigration into our land at the time. Our people got violent. It's understandable that they revolted and were unaccepting of immigrants flooding into their land led by a foreign colonial power, especially when they were expecting sovereignty from the British like our Arab neighbors got.


Then I see channels like Middle East Eye recounting the events that led to the conflict; they start with the Belfour declaration and then just skip to the Nakba. We're just going to skip 30 years of back-and-forth violence that led to the '48 war. It was a war, by the way, that we lost badly. The Jews didn't wake up one day and barge into every Palestinian home to kick them out.


However, it seems any honest recount of history or critique of Palestinian history gets met with me being called a traitor. I'm just saying that our people back in the 1900s acted like any community would if a foreign power forced societal changes on them. There's no reason to paint us as saints.

I have always advocated for human rights, equity, and self-determination for Palestinians who are oppressed(to different extents) under Israel, a nation that commits itself to Jewish domination of institutions. I always voted and campaigned for progressive Democrats and I assisted with the Israeli Meretz party from abroad. This is why I think the current Palestinian-sympathetic movement is ruining the left:

1. **Abandonment of Pragmatism** \- Just like the 2020 George Floyd protests(""Defund the Police""), the Western left has completely embraced a suicidal strategy of idealistic radicalism. Many of those on the left insist the solution to the conflict is a one-state solution consisting of Palestine ""from the River to the Sea"". Unfortunately, they've appropriated the Palestinian mythology in their ambitions to magically destroy Israel and the ideology of Zionism by BDS somehow or supporting Palestinian ""armed struggle"". It doesn't take a lot of thought to see how both of those methods are incredibly ineffective and immoral to advocate for and implement. So, instead of a pragmatic approach, like empowering the Israeli left through donations and advocacy, supporting a reasonable solution(two-state or one-state under Israel), or calling for the ultimate humanitarian end to the war of a unilateral Hamas surrender, the Western left insists on a dream scenario that will never happen. This is the most egregious behavior of the left and it's their most common mistake(i.e. Vietnam). This is due to the fact that Palestinians, especially in Gaza, are suffering under disproportionate Israeli force with no Western movement to realistically end it. In fact, these Western leftists, due to these tactics, are assisting in empowering and legitimizing the far-right of Israel. They are the perfect strawman to turn people off to the left in Israel, which, in turn, results in a lengthened Palestinian suffering.
2. **Maximalism** \- There's a tendency on the left to outcompete each other in radicalism. It's not catchy or sexy to say ""The war tactics that Israel uses are disproportionate and don't consider enough of the humanitarian cost"", it has to be ""genocide"" or ""ethnic cleansing"" in order to provoke an emotional reaction from uneducated Westerners. It's not ""the security policy of Hafradah has resulted in reduced human rights of Palestinians compared to Israelis"", it has to be ""Apartheid""(with the only legal precedent being South Africa). These maximalist statements immeasurably hurt the movement for true progress on Palestinian human rights. It results in a boy-who-cried-wolf situation: If Israel decides to transfer the entire Gazan population to the Sinai, what is that called? A ""genocide""? Due to the present labeling of the war, nobody will believe it. What if Israel permanently transfers or kills 100,000 Palestinian civilians? 200,000? 1 million? What will that be called? How can it get worse than ""genocide""? This Maximalist rhetoric is not only inaccurate, but it's incredibly damaging to describe the proportionate extent of Palestinian suffering, which is vital to any movement that faithfully advocates for an upliftment of Palestinian life and identity.
3. **Normalization of Bigotry** \- Explicit or latent Jew-Hatred is being increasingly embraced by radical sections of the Western left. Tropes such as ""Zionist""(a euphemism for ""Jew"" for many) control of governments or blood libel. Wishing ""Death to Zionists"" or equating them with Nazis is, in most cases, latent Jew-Hatred. Regardless of your thoughts on the definition of Zionism(there is no definition, it is a meaningless term), it's clear that many believe that ""Zionists"" are just uppity Jews. Of course, this is genuinely believed by a small portion of the left. However, a substantial part of Western leftists has repeatedly failed to condemn this Jew-Hatred and to stop mirroring the language of these latent or explicit Jew-Haters. This is 1000x worse in the case of Israelis. For Western leftists, it's normal to call Israelis ""colonizers"", ""demons"", ""rapists"", and ""child-murderers"" on their social media without repercussion or introspective irony. As somebody belonging to the Israeli nationality, I have been desensitized to the insane amount of bigotry from those that I formerly respected. However, many Israelis or Jews aren't as depersonalized as I am, and they definitely take the bigotry to heart. What do you think results from that? Usually, a vote for Likud(Netanyahu's Party) or a donation to AIPAC. Thus, propagating a cycle of bigotry and continuing the suffering of Palestinians.
4. **Propaganda** \- This war has sparked the largest disinformation campaigns in human history. Multiple state entities (Israel, U.S., Russia, Iran, Qatar) and numerous private entities are pumping out loads of propaganda in order to manipulate uneducated Westerners into supporting their interests. Since October 7th, known Russian disinformation propagator, Jackson Hinkle, has skyrocketed in followers due to his ability to mislead Western leftists on the war. I have seen an unfathomable amount of reposts from Al Jazeera and MiddleEastEye, known Qatari state propaganda and major propagates of misinformation. I have always appreciated the value of institutional skepticism that embodied many of the historical and academic leftist leaders. However, right now, those values are completely thrown out in favor of Russia or Iran's geopolitical advocacy of ""everything the West does is bad"". The previous three points of behavior are certainly emboldened by the paid disinformation and bots that propagate anti-Western sentiment to destabilize Western democracy. Meanwhile, the basic interests of Palestinian civilians are left unregarded while these state operatives kill their only lifeline.
5. **Reactionary Resurgence** \- One of the main factors that attracted me to the left was its rejection of reactionary ideology(the establishment of traditional institutions from the past). For Israelis and Palestinians, reactionary rhetoric is normalized and encouraged in many cases. However, this reactionary ideology that has plagued those who share my nationality has spread to Western leftists in their advocacy for Palestine. Western leftists constantly appropriate the far-right and reactionary talking points that many radicalized Palestinians spout. An example would be the insistence on the exclusive indigeneity of Palestine from the River to the Sea, which abandons the progressive values of anti-nationalism and intersectionality. Another example would be the appropriation of Palestinian Martyrdom, in which many of them embraced the idea that human life can be inherently reduced to a political or national cause by their manner of death. This is a clear rejection of the values of individualism, secularism, and anti-nationalism.
6. **Historical Negligence** \- Those who are even a little bit informed on the Israel-Palestinian Conflict understand that the conflict is too complex to be treated as a soccer match of Israelis vs. Palestinians. Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders set roadblocks to an equitable peace, while many others progressed the conflict to a more positive state. Even more than the historical complexity of this conflict, evaluating the moral complexity requires a graduate degree in a relevant field with hundreds of hours of research. I typically advise not to trust anybody's commentary of the conflict with any less credibility than the previous sentence. However, the Western left has instead decided to follow the historical and moral analysis of demagogues. There's constantly factually wrong or misleading historical information on many of these Palestinian-sympathetic accounts. An example is the map of a ""disappearing Palestine"" that millions have reposted, a blatantly misleading map meant to depict ""Zionist colonization"", meanwhile, neglecting the historical borders of the conflict. There are many other forms of historical negligence that they commonly employ that are extremely damaging for understanding the conflict.

In conclusion, Western leftists are keeping up with the Western traditions of white saviorism and interfering with this particular trendy foreign conflict. I could have written a few more grievances that I have of the Western left(including the embracement of far-right Islamist groups) but I wanted to keep the post relatively short. In several months, Western leftists will forget about the Gazans suffering under the disproportional force of the IDF. Nobody will self-criticize the ideas or tactics that they engaged in, meanwhile, the Israeli left-wing and reliable non-Hamas Palestinian advocacy organizations are left in the dust by an ineffective white-savior-esqe Western movement. Not only that but due to all of these factors making the left look like lunatics, Biden and the Democrats are being affected in the polling, which may result in Trump being elected, a terrible outcome for Palestinians.

If you want to respond to me, **please avoid strawmanning or whataboutism**. I acknowledge that the state of Israel and Jewish-""advocacy"" organizations are partially responsible for worsening the grievances listed above. However, I know from posting on this sub before, that 50% of the comments are going to be either misrepresenting my stated position or trying to ""hypocrisy-burn"" me.

Scrolling through TikTok as I normally do has lead me to seeing some videos related to the ongoing war. Something I’ve found is the incredibly antisemitic videos that are everywhere with all the comments being swastikas and people saying to kill all the Jews. I found a slideshow which had a picture of ‘Jews now’ and then the second image of ‘Where Jews belong’ showing a gas chamber.

It’s just kind of crazy to me how this is happening and even worse after trying to report the video and some of the comments that were very clearly hate speech (had multiple swastika emojis) TikTok found ‘no violation’.

Just kind of shocking that this is happening and it’s being sort of allowed.",388,1764slv,410,1697110412.0

As I start every post: I am a 17 year old girl from Tel Aviv, I was protesting for Palestinian rights since I was five. I am neither ""pro Palestine"" or ""pro Israel""

For about a week or two, there were rumours and buzzes about an Iran attack that is coming soon. Both on the news, and general panic in Israeli social media. I've dismissed it and convinced myself that their tactic is to scare us thru Iranian bots and that no attack is going to happen. For context, I've never lived during an attack from a force other then Hammas and their made-in-china rockets.

Yesterday I was on my way to a friend's birthday in central Tel Aviv,  on my way there my friend started texting me saying she is worried because of things she sees on tiktok. I told her to not believe anything she sees there, and there's no Iranian attack coming. Not even 15 minutes later the government releases a message that school is cancelled tomorrow (which there was already none of, because of Passover. So it was basically a message saying ""some bad-shittery is about to go down tomorrow""). I was starting to stress out but I still went to celebrate the birthday. Around 10pm one of the people in the birthday gets up and whispers in the birthday girl's ear ""some fireworks are about to go off in an hour"" which meant there are rumours that rockets are about to shoot. 

We all decided that if Iran drops an atom bomb and we're all gonna die, were at least going to get fucked up tonight and continued drinking and having fun. But everyone started stressing more and more, and one couple decided they rather go home, near a bomb shelter. We wanted to keep the party going so we paid and decided to go to one of the guys house and keep drinking there. Five guys went by car and me and the birthday girl went by bus. Before we even managed to reach the bus station we get a call from the guys (which are also IDF soldiers) all they said was ""don't come. It's going to be a rough night, get some sleep"". We got really stressed and decided to go to my house.

On the bus a ticket guy started checking tickets and an old lady started yelling ""we are going to die! And you are worried about tickets?? Shame on you!"" Then we got off and got to my house. In my house the news were open on the TV, which is rare in my house, and my mom was packing a big bag in case we will need to stay in the bomb shelter for a long time. We started watching the news, and suddenly, they were off. They said the war planes are on their way to us. They started by saying we have seven hours until they reach. We all sat in silence in front of the news, watched the hours go down. Six hours, five hours, three hours, half an hour. Ten minutes. They said they were sending ballistic rockets too. They started reaching the north, then the south, then everywhere. Admittedly they didn't reach Tel Aviv. We stayed up all night watching the iron dome blow up the rockets and the planes.
Jordan, USA, Britain and maybe Iraq also stopped the planes and rockets
 And finally went to sleep for an hour in 5am. Woke up to see the news, Iran said they won't attack again if Israel won't attack back, but of course our kindergarten of a government will attack back. The next days are not going to be calm, I'm safe, one Israeli Muslim kid died from the rockets, 32 went to the hospital from aggressive anxiety attacks. Pray for us.",386,1c3owhq,1066,1713084144.0

Her interview that was posted yesterday by Israeli media, in the interview she is talking about her captivity and it brings out a lot of questions- a lot of people are talking about the ""innocent civilians"" in Gaza but Mia is talking about those- the kids who would mock her, laugh at her, take food from her and the wives who had witnessed everything and starved her on purpose.

Are there any innocents there? do they all comply and even happily collaborate with Hamas? it brings to mind the pictures of the kidnapped being released by the red cross- how Palestinians will gather around them, mock them, take pictures of them, try to scare them as they leave- all in civilian clothing.

&#x200B;

some quotes:

“It’s important to me to reveal the real situation about the people who live in Gaza, who they really are, and what I went through there,” she told Channel 13 news. “I experienced hell. Everyone there are terrorists… there are no innocent civilians, not one,” she said. “\[Innocent civilians\] don’t exist.”

He “started to touch me, in the upper part of my body,” gesturing toward her chest. “And I started to scream, to go crazy, amid the burning cars, the bodies.” Then the terrorist, she said, saw the situation with her arm and “recoiled, and stopped for a moment.”

Schem said she didn’t see the face of the person who operated on her, but “he looked at me and he said, ‘You’re not going home alive.'”

She described a moment when one of the youngest children of the family entered her room, “opened a bag of sweets, closed it, came up next to me, opened the bag, closed it and then left.”

Schem said she believes the only reason her captor did not rape her is that “his wife and children were in the next room. His wife hated the fact that he was alone in the room with me. Hated it. So she would play games with me.”

His wife would bring her husband food, “and not bring me food,” she recounted. “A day, two days, three days, I wouldn’t eat… She was so terrible, she had mean eyes. She was a very evil woman.”

Let me also clarify, that I don’t agree with the right wing position on this subject either (basically just the opposite of this, supporting Israel and downplaying their government’s atrocities). But, as a member of multiple leftist communities on this site, I am constantly seeing people fully supporting Palestine with the justification that what Hamas does isn’t as bad as what Israel does. I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence, but what I don’t understand is everyone chanting “Free Palestine” and showing no remorse for the Israeli people that were harmed. About the phrase “Free Palestine”: on a surface level, this phrase is perfectly fine. However, I like to compare this phrase to the phrase “All Lives Matter”. On a surface level, there’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s the stigma and history behind it that makes it offensive to say. With all lives matter, it’s due to it being against the blm movement, and with free Palestine, especially since these horrific events occurred, it’s due to the phrase subtly implying that the actions of Hamas are justifiable, and even more so, completely disregarding the suffering of those in Israel. Now, I really want to give the left the benefit of the doubt that they don’t support Hamas, but it’s starting to get really difficult, with people implying that their actions are for a greater cause. I’m not necessarily saying that they support Hamas, but I really am starting to see a pattern of them never bringing up the horrible things Hamas has done and only hating on Israel; same with the right, they only talk about how horrible Hamas is with no regards to the atrocities of the Israeli government. I’m not saying that it’s a 50/50 necessarily, but neither side is justified in the slightest, and all our support should be aimed towards the innocent people of both sides rather than the oppressors of either side. I really want to understand the left on this, because it feels so bizarre that I’d disagree with them so hard on this, but I just can’t.",387,179bvvf,1124,1697478201.0

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1c3zeio/can_we_all_just_agree_that_killing_civilians_is/,Can we all just agree that killing civilians is bad and cheering it is repulsive?,"When the October 7th attack occurred, many pro-Palestinians cheered it as the Israelis getting their just deserts for their oppression and occupation of Palestinians. Conversely many pro-Israelis began salivating about the inevitable retaliation and how it would 'turn Gaza into a parking lot' as I remember one person commenting.

Six months later, the Gaza Strip has been nearly flattened and many supporters of Israel thinks that this is justified because of the Gazans who paraded and celebrated over the October 7th massacre.

Recently we've had the Iranian missile attack on Israel (which thankfully caused almost no casualties). On subs like 'AskMiddleEast', you see many people cheering at Israelis running to shelters on the streets and hiding in shelters or even at fake news showing Israelis fleeing the country, and what do they say? They say 'it serves them right for supporting the bombing / genocide of Gazans'. Other charming comments include 'I hope they get a taste of what Gazans went through', 'now its their turn'.

In my opinion, anyone treating this war as a sports match, anyone who celebrates the killing of civilians is a disgusting depraved ghoul of a human being. And the pathetic thing is that people who do this on both sides imagine that they're better than the people doing it on the other side.

I would hope that we could all agree that:

1. There's no excuse for the intentional killing of civilians under any circumstances.
2. One should never celebrate or cheer military actions that endanger civilians, even if civilian casualties are not intended.
3. In general, one should not celebrate military action, it should always be seen as a regrettable tragedy to have to kill, even if it's necessary and even when the people being killed are combatants.

There's a cycle of escalation. Hamas massacred civilians, so Israel invades and bombs the Gaza Strip and kills lots of civilians in the process. This radicalizes and angers people across the Islamic World, and Iranian proxies like Hebollah and the Houthis attack Israelis. Israel bombs an Iranian consulate, so Iran launches drones and missiles at Israel. And what's Israel going to do next? I don't know. But I really hope this cycle breaks, there's enough killing and destruction as it is, there's no sense in it expanding to lead to more death and destruction in more places. 

But it seems lots of people are satisfied for the war to escalate and end up killing more Israelis and Palestinians, in addition to Lebanese, Yemenis, Iranians, and so on, just as long as they don't get affected.",379,1c3zeio,760,1713116879.0

I do feel horrible about every single person hurt in this conflict, especially children.

However, there so many wars in the world at any given moment, no one knows about, but so much pressure on Israel!

If it's not on CNN, it didn't happen, ask an average person about any other wars going on RIGHT now.

The last point. Americans (the good guys) bombed civilians in WWII, like there' no tomorrow, razed Dresden, never mind Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Killed countless civilians in Korea, Vietnam.

This is my sisters documentation of the hamas attack event she was through yesterday in Be’eri near Gaza. My sister is only 20 years old, she went to a party with her boyfriend and they  found themselves in a battlefield. She didn’t mention but I will, In these 6hours of hiding she held her hurt head friend with a towel on his wound and saved his life. When soldiers came to rescue them after six hours and asked them to take bodies from the field she performed CPR on few of them. She recognized her friends among the hundreds of bodies. Now read her documentation (which I translated using ChatGPT)


""My heart is shattered.
Yesterday morning, rockets started during the party. We quickly started to pack everything to flee as fast as we could, and then we heard gunshots from both entrances to the party. According to reports, we understood that there were terrorists on every road, and we decided to stay in the area of the party where there was police and  gunshots and our jeep was targeted. We started to flee. We were surrounded by terrorists from all directions, who kept shooting at our car. We piled up on each other in the car and tried to escape in every possible direction. We saw an IDF jeep on a hill and decided to approach it to at least be close to weapons. The jeep was abandoned and bloodied. We managed to grab some weapons found there, which turned out to be jammed, and tried to fix them while escaping. We saw our friends falling one by one to the ground from the gunshots. We managed to escape towards the fields when suddenly a group of 10 terrorists jumped us. If not for the driving skills of my partner, Dor, I don't know what would have happened to us. After about an hour of escaping from groups of terrorists and gunshots everywhere, we stopped the car to check the surroundings, understand where the gunshots were coming from, and decide the best escape route. Another group of 8 terrorists on motorcycles approached us. Two friends, Oded and Alex, couldn't get back in the car and just ran towards the fields to hide. The group kept chasing us with a barrage of bullets. A friend who sat in the back was shot in the head. Dor performed a drift, knocking down two terrorists on a motorcycle, definitely killing one. As we escaped from this group, another group started chasing us, with us having a gunshot victim in the car. The police didn't know where to direct us, and the dispatcher on the line told us to head to Ba'ari, just to make sure there were our forces at the entrance. On the way to Be’eri, another group of 4 terrorists sprayed bullets at us. We arrived at the entrance to Be’eri, and there were just bodies everywhere, no sign of our forces. We began to hear shouts in Arabic and by a miracle that only God could have made, I found a toilet that was unlocked. We hid there for about 6 hours. 
When we realized we were in a building of a Hamas cell, and they were constantly close to the toilet window and door, there were several military attempts against the terrorists in Ba'ari. After hearing them shooting and starting to sing in Arabic, we realized we were alone. We kept silent and tried to breathe quietly, spread towels on the floor to avoid any noise of movement, and prayed for our lives. The bathroom door didn't have a lock, and Dor had to hold it for 6 hours while staying close to the wall. The door was made of glass so if they tried to open it, they'd think it was locked. I and the injured person hid behind a curtain, using towels and paper to stop the bleeding and keep him conscious. The building we were in was hit by 7 RPG rockets, 3 missiles, and countless bullet sprays for 6 hours! Everything was destroyed except the small space we were in; only the ceiling and walls fell and crumbled on us. We remained silent, neither when missiles were launched at us nor during the shootings. The main thing was to stay quiet. For 6 hours, the military and all the units knew exactly where we were, but no one came. 6 hours of eternity, we couldn't believe we came out of it alive. 2 soldiers arrived from a nearby post, having escaped from terrorists themselves. We helped them carry the wounded and traumatized. The area around us was full of bodies and body parts. We loaded an unconscious but breathing man with gunshot wounds all over his body and decided to head towards the nearest checkpoint. We reached them, handed over the wounded who were taken in an armored vehicle to the hospital. We remained at the checkpoint for another 3 hours, under gunfire because it wasn't safe to go on the road, but with armed soldiers and police, it felt safer. It's an open miracle that we managed to survive and come out alive; God heard my prayers and cries. 

Although the army couldn't reach us, I'm deeply grateful. When we reached the first checkpoint and the soldier hugged me, I felt as safe as possible in a battlefield. The road was full of bodies, smoke, and abandoned cars containing bodies and parts of what was once a human being. My body still hurts from all the hits we took while driving and the debris that fell on us in hiding. The emotional pain of seeing our friends killed, countless bodies (I estimate more than 150 people dead that we saw) and several traumatized we tried to help, will never fade. We went out to dance and ended up in a battlefield. May God protect all of Israel and our soldiers. Amen. Sending strength to all the families. We will get through this 🙏.""",370,1739sut,63,1696798811.0

For starters, there are over 7 million people living there, majority of them being 2nd and 3rd generation Israelis. Do you really think that all of them are just going to get up and leave? 

Israel is also a nuclear power and are hellbent on keeping our ancestral home, do you really think that they are going to give it up any time soon? Even if all 2 billion Muslims tried to invade, do you honestly think this would result in anything less than mutually assured destruction (M.A.D)? Even if the Arabs were successful in invading Israel and killing all of the Jews, do you honestly think that the Jews would go out without a bang? If this happened, then kiss goodbye to the whole of the Middle East, it would be Armageddon. 

If you are so misinformed and uneducated to believe that Jews do not come from the Levant (despite the literally overwhelming amount of evidence from History, Archaeology, Culture etc.), and are unhappy with Jews living in Israel and having their own state, then I think you should probably get over it because you are literally wasting your time and energy on demanding that the Jews leave.

I hate my government for transferring money to Hammas. I hate the government for the way they fight in Gaza. Barely helping the hostages, ruining our connections to the western world, turning Israel to a third world country. Deviding our people. Dreanching our history in innocent blood. 

I hate the west (mostly of my generation) for the uneducated good for nothing activism. Turning the words Zionist, Israeli, and Jewish into insults. Not understanding anything about what it's like living in a war. I hate them for ruining my dreams. I used to be a person just like them, I had dreams of making films in Europe, films about romance and the human nature. Now I am forever bound to acknowledge my Israeli and Jewish background in anything I do. Now I will forever have to start any piece of media by saying I protested for Palestinian rights, and that I am not like my government. I used to be a normal teenager, also having my four-month activism phases for BLM and gay rights, I will never be a tiktok activist for anything. I will simply never believe them. Celebs I loved and appreciated were posting story's on insta telling their enormous audiences that they wish my home country was obliterated from existance. I used to be a normal teenager, I thought the breakup at age 15 is the worst thing to ever happen. Then the war started. I will never relate to any teenage experience again. I remember that on the 7.10, I was scrolling thru twitter in the bomb shelter to keep my mind off the boom sounds, and I saw a post saying ""the worst thing to happen to a girl is wearing a nice outfit to a shitty party"". Then I realised I truly wouldn't be able to ever relate to westners ever again. I hate the west for dumbing everything down to ""Israel or Palestine"". As if that means anything. As if this is a football match.

I hate Hammas for everything. For killing and kidnapping, for the rape and the beheading. I am making a short doco about a 12 year old girl from a kibbutz who been thru 7.10. she has been thru a holocaust. Simply no other way to explain it.

I have spent the last three years studying the conflict in great detail, devoting an entire year to it at the hebrew university of jerusalem. I've studied under Palestinian Arab, Palestinian Christian, Israeli Jewish, European Jewish, and European Christian professors. I spent the last week and a half nonstop trying to write about this conflict to submit something to my university paper but every time I finish a draft I feel like it both over and under sympathizes with both sides. To put it briefly: I'm torn.

I understand that antisemitism has defined Jewish existence for the past 2000+ years: our expulsion from the Middle East, persecution in Ethiopia, genocide in Germany and pogroms in Russia are only the most recent proof of this. I understand that the only way to secure Jewish protection is through a Jewish majority state with Jewish governance.

But nothing that I've learned has justified in my mind the occupation of 5 million Palestinians. The daily tortures and miseries they have gone through in the West Bank and Gaza since the 40s is too inhumane for words. And I can't justify the fact that we deny 13 million Palestinians their right of return. After Jews were expelled, 15 distinct empires controlled that area - the Palestinian people are the amalgam of residents left behind, and possess claims to the land nearly as ancient as ours. The idea that us jews have a right of return, but palestinians do not, seems criminal to me, like we're making palestinians pay the price of suffering that had nothing to do with them.

In my mind a Confederation solution would be ideal, where two independent states are created, their border dissolved into a dotted line and residents allowed to live in either territory. A third, joint government would handle things like security, resources, and the economy. But I feel like the existing hegemony between Israel and Palestine would not be fully dissolved as long as there existed two independent states, and as long as there is a hegemony there will be violence and oppression.

I don't know. I really don't know. I don't want to be considered a liberal brown-noser by my Jewish friends and I don't want my non-jew friends to call me a colonizer. I'm sick of feeling guilty for taking up space on social media to talk about antisemitism when all of this is going on, but I'm also sick of other Jews not talking enough about the crimes Israel is committing. I don't want to feel like I have to defend Israel's colonial practices (even if you don't think it was definitionally colonialism because we too are indigenous, our forced displacement of more than 1 million indigenous palestinians was objectively experienced as colonialism).

I don't know what to make of claims that Arabs and Jews simply can't live together. It seems so vile to assume that every Palestinian is a terrorist. And it seems so reductive and racist to believe that Palestinians are merely another extension of the 'Arab Kingdom'. But our ancestors were objectively all kicked out of every Arab country within the last half century. the last of yemen's jews were literally exiled last week. it doesn't feel like it's my place to tell the children of these refugees that arabs are all good and fine to live with. but it also seems like the region will never have peace if we don't coexist in a confederation-like or secular democratic state, and israel's war crimes will only increase.

I'm just, I hate this. I live in a house of leftist athiests, there's not a lot of room for sympathy for religious ethnostates that actively oppress an indigenous population. Does anyone else feel this way????? What happens now??

Pro-Israel, Anti-Netanyahu, Pro-Palestine, Anti-Hamas?","Everyone is so polarised online. I feel like views that acknowledge the pros and cons of each side are rare. 

My personal view:

- Israel has a right to exist. They DO exist. They are going nowhere. Until Palestinian leadership acknowledge this fact, no meaningful solution can found

- Hamas is a terror organisation who have shown they are war criminals and incapable of peace. There is no justification for their actions. 

- I believe that moderate Palestinians exist who would be willing to acknowledge Israel, as the PLO/PA have done in the past. Such leaders are the only possible partners in peace

- I hate Bibi intensely. He must take serious blame for weakening Israel’s democracy, inflaming tensions in Israel and in Palestine, and now, for leading Israel into what will be a long and costly war, all because he puts his own interests over the nation’s interest. I think he could prolong this war to keep himself out of jail for fraud

- Despite this, I think his policy of building relations across the Arab world was smart and must continue. If your enemy really don’t like it, you must be on to something

- Palestine has a right to exist. They DO exist, like Israel. The post-1967 War occupation of WB & Gaza was a massive mistake that should be reversed asap. Of course Gaza hasnt been occupied for 18 years and we saw how that went. And as above, Hamas must go and moderate leaders be found before any solution can occur. 

- The Free Palestine movement is full of lies and propaganda, including false claims of apartheid, genocide and war crimes. Many people who support them in western countries do so from a noble desire to help oppressed people and innocent victims, but unfortunately they also believe the many many lies (the recent hospital explosion is a good example) and the frankly anti-semitic tropes.

israelpalestine,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/183h8yc/seriously_stop_with_the_genocide_claims/,"Seriously, stop with the “genocide” claims.","The definition of genocide is:

“the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.”

There are many prominent figures repeating again and again that Israel is committing genocide. It’s actually disgraceful. It’s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last 50 years that no one cares about or even knows of.

Let me explain why the genocide claims are not true.

- Israel has no stated intention of committing genocide. The genocidal statements of some Israeli governments officials and representatives are not evidence of stated intention. They’re just a few peoples edgy opinions that are not carried out in a tangible way.

- Approximately 60,000 Palestinians have died since 1948, and most of the deaths have been during war periods. This averages out to about 800 per year. For reference, the Nazis killed about 1.5 million Jews per year between 1941 and 1945.

- The Palestinian population has gone up 4x since 1948. And the Gazan population has doubled since 2000.

- Israel have Gaza back in 2005. If they were hell bent on genocide, why would they do that.

- Israel supplies Gaza with free water and electricity (until recently). A very strange thing to do if you are wanting to commit genocide.

- Israel provides Palestinians with jobs and income. Another peculiar thing to do if one’s intent is to commit genocide.

- Israel has tried to offer the Palestinians their own state that they can have autonomy over. A very very ridiculous thing to do if you wanted to eradicate a nation or group of people.

- Israel provides humanitarian aid to Gazans. Furthermore, Israel built and funded a lot of the infrastructure in Gaza in the 80s and 90s to prop it up and promote health services. Weird for a genocidal country to do that.

- Death toll =/= genocide. Yes, understanding 10,000 plus Gazans have died, is not evidence of genocide. You must understand why and how they have died. Did America commit genocide against the Japanese, Iraqis, Afghans and Germans? Did England commit genocide against the Germans, Turks and Italians? No of course not. They were fighting and the unfortunate result was loss of civilians life. That is not evidence of genocide.

Yes, I’m sure you can point to a few people in the Israeli government who have said some not so smart things about solving the Palestine issue. And you can also point to bad apples in the IDF who have acted out of line and been disciplined for it. However, this is not evidence of genocide. You actually have to commit genocide to be accused of genocide. I’m also referring to Raz Segal, Owen Jones and Norman Finkelstein. Their claims are ridiculous, especially coming from University professors and I urge them to look at the many other genocides that have actually occurred and study those to understand what an actual genocide looks like.",355,183h8yc,2117,1700909425.0

 As a middle aged Asian American man, I've experienced how bad racism can be, and so I don't think I can recover from the vile anti-Semitism I've seen from pro Palestinian supporters both here in the US, and in other countries.

I thought anti-Semitism went out with the Jim Crow laws, except for crazy neo Nazi nut bags and old fat dudes in white cloaks and hoods.

This year has been a rude awakening. Anti-Semitism is alive and well, and it is thriving.

Pro Palestinians say that they're not anti Jew, they're anti Zionist. Then why are they vandalizing Jewish owned restaurants in New York City, and marching to Jewish owned falafel shops in Philadelphia?

Do you think that Starbucks is being boycotted because corporate HQ said that the actions of one union store supporting Palestine didn't speak for the company? Or is it because the CEO Howard Schultz is a Jew?

C'mon, be honest. They don't even have Starbucks in Israel. You just don't want to support a Jewish owned business. I've seen this and been there earlier in life.I grew up in the Detroit area where people paid for raffle tickets to smash Toyotas. Life wasn't that comfortable for people who looked like me. Got told to ""go back to JAPAN!"" 

It's the same shit happening for Jews today. 
The way those racists said JAPAN is the EXACT SAME way I hear people say ""ZIONIST."" There's some extra heat in the way people say it. It's just Kike 2.0.

And it's pretty clear that a lot of people don't support a two state solution. They want the Jews in Israel gone. European settler/colonialists blah blah.

Man, I thought the Jews would have at least a century to have their own country before people who couldn't point it out on a map says it should disappear.

Then the war on Ukraine happened and as an Arab, people around me in my society and on Facebook we're celebrating screaming that ""it's sinners killing sinners let God take them all""

What happened to standing with the innocent? 

So it appears that Arabs/ Muslims don't care about the innocent people in Palestine they just care about the land itself because it has religious meaning to them (it is literally connected to the judgment Day in islam, the day Palestine is free is the day of judgment for Muslims)

“The terrorist organization Hamas chose to harm Israel strategically in two clear ways – kidnapping citizens and committing sadistic sexual crimes,” said ARCCI CEO Orit Sulitzeanu. “Silence will be remembered as a historical stain on those who chose to remain silent and deny the sexual crimes committed by Hamas.”

The report revealed that Hamas terrorists threatened victims, often injured women, with weapons in order to rape them violently, often collectively with collaboration between multiple terrorists.

Partners, family, and friends were forced to watch to “increase the pain and humiliation for all present.”

Most of those sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists were killed afterward, and some even during the act of rape. Others still were found dead later, their genitals mutilated beyond recognition or penetrated with weapons.

**The full extent of Hamas's sexual crimes will probably never be known**

The report highlighted that it cannot provide the full numerical measure of the extent of Hamas’s sexual violence, “most of which resulted in the victims' deaths, making their full extent unknown and possibly unknowable.”

The sexual assaults occurred in four main locations: At the Nova Festival, in kibbutzim, on IDF bases, and in captivity.

Severe sexual assaults were reported on multiple occasions by eye-witnesses and first responders in the Nova Festival, including group rapes. On kibbutzim, women and girls alike were brutally assaulted, including at least one case of a knife being hidden in the genital organ of one such victim.

Soldiers on IDF bases were victims of sexual violence, as well, their bodies clearly indicated. Hostages who have returned from Gaza have revealed grotesque sexual violence towards the hostages, as well.

“As the scars in our hearts refuse to heal, and the souls of our sisters and brothers cry out to us from the depths of the earth, a significant portion of those we considered partners responded in silence and denial of these horrors,” the report’s authors, Dr. Carmit Klar-Chalamish and Noga Berger, wrote. “We call on you to raise your voices and not allow the cries of these victims to fade away.”

______________________

As more and more evidence about Hamas's atrocious sexual violence comes to light, the silence of the UN, women's organizations and the entire people who call themselves ""Pro-Palestinians"" is becoming extremely loud.

What has happened in October 7 would not be tolerated by any people, any country, and Israel is obligated to make sure the Palestinians in Gaza do not have the ability to do something such as this ever again.

It is a huge tragedy yet amusing at the same time watching the ""Anti-Zionist"" crowd denying this, exactly like past generations denied or reduced past atrocities done to Jews, and even launch ""Counter"" investigations based on no evidence at all trying their absolute best to create some equivalency between raping terrorists and the IDF. With reporters such as the infamous antisemitic [Francesca Albanese](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-palestinian-rights-officials-social-media-history-reveals-antisemitic-comments/) leading the charge as you expect.

I hope Israelis will never forget how the world is reacting to what Hamas did. I know I never could have imagined I would be living to see yet another massive pogrom done to Jews only to be ignored and denied by the world.",335,1aw64g2,1180,1708500161.0

*Here is something from the book:*

**The Middle East Is Not Catching Up**  
The most frustrating thing in the world, even more annoying than woke students who complain about every little microaggression, is a fundamentalist who is racist, homophobic & misogynistic, but is always crying about how unjust the world is. Most people in the Middle East are in fact not politically correct at all, do not want to be, and hate the guts of anyone who is. Here is an example from real-life people who said that stuff to me:  
Jamal, Palestinian-American: ""I don't mind people being racist to their occupiers or their oppressors. It's below on my list of priorities tbh"".  
Jay, Israeli-American: ""Do not talk to me about reparations, we don't owe nobody nothing""

The thing nobody mentions when they shout out about terrorism in the f\*\*d up old people news is that people who hang around terrorists long enough become terrorists themselves. Think about it for a second, it's very hard to have an alcoholic abusive father & survive without being a little abusive yourself.

I can't tell you how many times I heard some European girl say that Israeli & Palestinian men are exactly the same. I can see that honestly, same looks, same attitude, same misogyny. I can't tell if a guy is Palestinian or Israeli before they start speaking, and if I didn't know what Arabic sounds like, no way in hell I see a difference. Those men have been living next to each other for 100 years, be enemies or friends, eventually, they become more like each other than like anybody else.

But who started this extremism path, is it Hamas when it blew up buses in the 90's? or is it extreme Israelis who killed Rabin & put Netanyahu in power? Or was it Israel when it made a third of Palestinians refugees in 1948? Or maybe it was Arabs who killed Jews in the 1930s. Or maybe it was Britain who colonized this land in the first place!?! Who gives a fuck, if you are smart, you will never play this game.

What I say is that we are done with apologies. We've created in this place an exciting special human mix of people that've learned to live together, both jews, druzes, beduis, cherks, christians and muslims and gained with this country some most exciting records under the blue-white flag of Israel FROM SCRATCH in only 75 years.

""Does 1M$ ferrari has a right to exist?""   
Many might have an opinion about that, except the ferrari owner itself which shouldn't care. Israel is the ferrari of the middle east at any aspect. It pushes the world into wonderful progress at any aspect. It stands at the top of the cake as a cherry of pioneering in so many aspects which older and much experinced nations have failed to mange. It shines as a diamond in innovation, sciences, tech, arts and research. Such a nation shouldn't wrestle with the question of whether it deserves to exist. It should stand as a lighthouse in the dark and If necessary, even silence anyone who ask stupid questions by it's great force.

Even worse is that very often the standard by which our equality is judged is of itself testament to that inequality, i.e. being compared to Muslims in foreign lands instead of Jewish citizens of the same country. Meanwhile, issues that would spark unstoppable outrage in the western world have long taken a backseat to more pressing issues of crime and poverty. We have simply learned to *accept* them as reality, but they are nonetheless unforgotten and serve as a constant reminder to our inequality. One of the main issues that contributed to the formation of our identity and that understandably results in significant portions of our community identifying more strongly with the Palestinian people is the question of land.

I will use my own family as an example. My family on both my father's and mother's side (all citizens) owns land in the north located in what later became a small Jewish community settlement. We have long given up trying to get permission to build on this land or to at least have it swapped for another land by the Israel Land Authority. Meanwhile, (literally) adjacent to this land from multiple directions you will find Jewish residences. It just so happens that the Arab owned land in this area is not designated for building. To even physically access our own land is a major hassle that requires coordination with the settlement days upfront. And what about getting approved by the responsible board as members of an exclusively Jewish settlement? We have better chances at winning the lottery.

The only thing left for us to do would be to sell the land to the settlement. For this and other reasons I cannot consider myself equal in my citizenship to Jews. Certainly not when all it takes is to stand on my own land and look to my immediate right and left to experience inequality. I wish things were different.",334,otuspm,426,1627554204.0

They pretty much started a war they cannot win. In doing so they caused the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. Also what’s crazy is they blame Israel for everything. For example when Israel shut off their water and power everyone was complaining that Israel was being mean and committing war crimes. How about not committing terrorist attacks on the people that supply you with power and water. Or if you really need to commit a terrorist attack, make sure you become self sufficient and supply your own water and power first.

Here’s a meme which pretty much sums up Hamas.

https://imgflip.com/i/88uny1

Honestly if Hamas actually wanted to succeed in their terrorism against Israel what they should have done is spent 50 years not attacking Israel and instead build up their society. 50 years where they set up their own infrastructure and build up their society. Start producing their own power and water. Use some of the billions they received in aid to buy fighter jets so they have some air power. 

The problem with that strategy is that terrorism relies on them having hate in their hearts and if they spent 50 years building a society they couldn’t hold that hate in their hearts. If they actually spent 50 years building a beautiful society they would actually care about their society and wouldn’t throw it away in a useless attack on Isreal.",321,18f82ke,1917,1702227981.0

Two days ago, I woke up to a phonecall. I'm a dog boarder, and it was a client. It was saturday morning, and I was surprised to hear from him, but he said he'd been called up for reserve duty and needed to board his dog with me immediately. I said of course. This was my first hint that something unusual was going on.

I opened up my phone and checked the news. Since then, I've been glued to my phone. I've seen all the videos you've seen. I've watched the videos of confused children being poked and prodded and told ""say mother again! say it!"" I've seen the videos of rooms full of dead bodies, pools of blood, and terrorists shooting the dead bodies. I've seen the video of the terrorist with the garden hoe attempting to decapitate a still living, gut-shot foreign agricultural worker, who was just a refugee looking for a better life. I've seen the mothers sobbing. I've seen the piles of bodies. I've seen the terrified 18 year olds being dragged away on motorcycles. I've seen terrorists kicking restrained hostages, screaming curses at them. I've seen people in the streets of gaza celebrating the slaughter.

I've seen it all. The daughter of a family friend was taken with her two children, aged 4 and 1.5, while her husband heard it happen over the phone. The two children were later found, abandoned but alive, on the gaza border. The mother hasn't been seen since.

My heart aches, and I am as angry as I've ever been. I want these fuckers to pay. I want the Hamas terrorists to be removed from this earth.

But yeah, like the title said, the bloodthirstiness I've been seeing in the comments disturbs me. I've seen commenters hoping that the 2.3 MILLION people in gaza get exterminated, because ""they voted for Hamas"". Never mind that the election was in 2006, and since then there hasn't been an election. And never mind that 47% of Gazans are children, all of which could not have voted in 2006, and most of which weren't even alive (or if they were, were in diapers). So, these children, many of which I'm sure are currently hoping I die a terrible death, have never known anything but the shit-show that is Hamas run Gaza.

Millions of people. Half of them children. And commenters on this sub are hoping many of them die. That's fucked up. Most people in gaza have as little to do with what's happened to my family friend's daughter as I do, and they should pay for the terrible war crimes commited by Hamas? Keep in mind that if you say yes, you are saying the same thing as people who are currently cheering for the 800+ deaths in Israel.

This war is going to get much, much, much worse. But at the very least, you can be sad that there is going to be more loss of life, more suffering, more pain.

It's trite, but two wrongs don't make a right.

I hope Hamas is smashed to bits. I hope the Mossad hunts down every one of their leaders. I hope the fuckers who commited these attrocities are obliterated. But cheering for the deaths and suffering of a civilian population? That's fucked up.

In the room with me right now, I have Django, a Belgian Malinois and regular visitor. His owner/dad is down south right now, fighting. I believe he's special forces.

I also have Louis, a BBB (Big Brown Boy). His owners live up north, right by the border with Lebanon. They evacuated yesterday.

And today I had Chica arrive, about 3 hours ago. Her owners live down south, right by Gaza. They've been in their home nonstop, nearly 24/7 since this started. They were just allowed to leave their homes at 5pm today. The wife and all the children are staying in Jerusalem right now. The father is head of security in their town, and has stayed behind, and will for the duration. Chica, who spent all that time cooped up with her terrified owners, is stressed out. She's crying right now, and I need to go sit with her. Her owners are scared too. They're scared for their father/husband. They don't know what happened to their friends from nearby towns that they can't get in touch with (thankfully their town didn't get hit hard and had no incursions).

They don't deserve to be scared. They didn't do anything to ask for this. My client, Django's owner, didn't do anything except sign up to protect his country. Louis's owners didn't do anything except buy a house in a small town that happens to be near Lebanon. I don't deserve to be scared either. We had two rocket attacks today. The air raid app on my phone starts alarming, and then I hear the sirens, and drag all the dogs into the shelter. Then I hear explosions in the distance (thankfully). Today one was close enough that I felt the pressure wave in my ear drums. I don't deserve this.

But neither do the vast majority of people in gaza. They've been handed the shittiest lot in life, and they have every right to be angry - with Israel, with Hamas, with life itself. Their lives are terrible, and they see no future. They live in hell. Don't be happy that their hell is getting even hotter.

israelwarvideoreport,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelWarVideoReport/comments/17a3zt6/why_are_palestinians_never_held_accountable_for/,Why are Palestinian’s never held accountable for their actions?,"I only see hate for Jews, so where is the anger and hate toward Hamas? 

Where are the true Palestinian supporters?

Hamas has misappropriated crucial resources intended for Gaza's development, such as building water pipelines, choosing instead to allocate those funds to rocket production. This diversion has had a detrimental effect on Gaza's potential to become a thriving coastal city, as infrastructure essential for the well-being of its residents has been neglected.

Why has Egypt been so reluctant to open their borders? Why? They’re brothers, so how could this be? Because welcoming Palestinians unfortunately means welcoming Hamas. Egypt's reluctance to open its borders to the Palestinian people is attributed to its concerns over Hamas's influence in the region. The presence of Hamas complicates the situation, but it’s a valid concern. The group's association with acts of violence and terrorism creates a reluctance to welcome Palestinians, despite the underlying desire to support their fellow Arabs.

It's essential to acknowledge the sufferings of the Palestinian people, particularly those living under the rule of Hamas. While it's not fair to hold all Palestinians accountable for the actions of this extremist group, addressing the root cause of the problem—Hamas's terrorism and leadership—is paramount. They voted them into power and gave up their own lives for them as a result. Eliminating Hamas's presence should be the initial step toward lasting peace and stability in the region. 

Over the years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seen numerous opportunities for peace and resolution, with individuals like Ariel Sharon proposing viable solutions. Great ones, in fact. Unfortunately, these opportunities were all met with resistance, and peace initiatives have been derailed. Let’s look at the 100 years of “NO” from Palestinian leadership:

1919: Arabs of Palestine refused to nominate representatives to the Paris Peace Conference.

1920: San Remo conference decisions, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.

1922: League of Nations decisions, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.

1937: Peel Commission partition proposal, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.

1938: Woodhead partition proposal, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.

1946: Anglo-American Commission proposal, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.

1947: UN General Assembly partition proposal (UNGAR 181), rejected by the Arab League and the Higher Arab Committee for Palestine/.

1949: Israel's outstretched hand for peace (UNGAR 194), rejected by the Arab League and the Higher Arab committee for Palestine.

1967: Israel's outstretched hand for peace (UNSCR 242), rejected by the Arab League and the PLO.

1978: Begin/Sa’adat peace proposal, rejected (except for Egypt) by the rest of the Arab world, including the PLO.

1994: Rabin/Hussein peace agreement, rejected by the rest of the Arab League (except for Egypt and Jordan).

1995: Rabin's Contour-for-Peace, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.

2000: Barak/Clinton peace offer, rejected by Yasser Arafat, who then initiated the pre-planned second intifada.

2001: Barak’s offer at Taba, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.

2005: Sharon's peace gesture, withdrawal from Gaza, rejected by the Hamas takeover in 2007.

2008: Olmert/Bush peace offer, rejected by Mahmoud Abbas.

2009 to present: Netanyahu's repeated invitations to peace talks, rejected.

2014: Kerry's Contour-for-Peace, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.

2018: Trump’s “deal of the Century”, rejected in advance by Mahmoud Abbas.

2019: US Conference on Economic Benefit for the Palestinians, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.

2020: PA reiterates rejection of Trump’s “Deal of the Century” before it’s even presented.

2020: Palestinian rejection of the normalization agreement between the UAE and Israel.

2020: Palestinian objections to Serbia and Kosovo moving their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Are no Palestinian supporters sickened by Hamas’s tactic in hiding in tunnels, using their own people as collateral despite knowing that they (Hamas) are Israel’s target? Hamas stayed with the innocent residents of Palestine on purpose! 

So, my question is simple: 

What was the purpose of the Oct 7 attacks? Can any Pro-Palestine person tell me what exactly was accomplished? What was the point?  It did absolutely NOTHING except kill thousands on both sides. 

What did they think would happen after an attack like that? What should Israel have done? Nothing? Truly, no response was expected?",217,17a3zt6,161,1697564508.0

Secondly the opportunities exist in the western world for Islamic peoples to flourish, but they bring there bullshit with them, they don’t assimilate and create self ruled enclaves which are a copy of the hell hole they flees from in the first place.  Personally I don’t think Islam in its current form can exist peacefully anywhere, ever.  The difference between Islam and all the other religions of the world is vastly different, they practice peace, Christianity is one of the most peaceful religions out there.  Now before all the lunatics start talking about 200 years ago or even longer, the world was a very different place even just 50 years ago let alone 200 or more.  I have no idea how to fix Islam, I don’t think you can.  What pisses me off the most is that no western government has asked its citizens what they want.  We just get told, you’re racist, you need to be tolerant, you just have to accept etc.  governments in the west are meant to protect and serve the people, not rule them.

Firstly, Suzanne Collins did say that she partially got the idea from flicking between channels showing reality TV interspersed with footage from the Iraq war so I guess there’s a good reason for me to be seeing similarities now.

But the fact it’s being live-streamed - the carnage - the propaganda - the fact that lots of us have been following the same few (often very young) journalists who have become the ‘face’ of Palestinian resistance (because right now journalism IS resistance being actively targeted by Israel) - it’s all crazy familiar.

I saw a clip of Israeli’s sitting on a hill watching and laughing at the ‘spectacle’ of the bombs dropping on Gaza today just minutes before Israel bombed the 3rd floor of a paediatric hospital.

The way not everyone in the capitol was evil or bad and some people actively supported the districts but realistically they were still complicit in the exploitation - even if just through ignorance.

The incredible amount of children dying - the bombing of hospitals and withholding of resources (like in Mockingjay) and the taking of people not involved in Hamas into administrative detention (hundreds arrested in the West Bank - like how the victors were taken in Catching Fire even the ones who weren’t involved in the rebellion).

The way Israel dropped pamphlets from the sky to tell Gazans to evacuate south and then bombed the route (literally straight out of the games I swear - the video of the pamphlets was like the scene with the parachutes in Mockingjay).

It’s so eerily similar and I just wonder how so many watched those films and read those books and are silent now - why could they identify resistance and oppression and desperation and exploitation in fiction and not reality? And I wonder if maybe it’s because we have to remind ourselves that we aren’t Katniss in this situation - we aren’t the heroes - we are the Capitol and District citizens watching it all happen on our screens - and that’s an unfortunate and uncomfortable concept to grapple with.",177,17pt2yq,41,1699359761.0

The WaPo report, alongside 2 other mainstream agencies and BellingCat, have concluded that an Israeli soldier likely killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.

It's important to look at this case from day 0 - to assess how the Israeli government reacted to the killing and to couch that reaction in historical context, with other killings of Palestinian civilians/journalists/medics. 

---

My summary of things so far:

#**[1] Blaming the victims.**

So initially, the Israeli government coordinated internally to cast blame on the Palestinians - with PM Bennett disseminating [a video that has since been widely discredited](https://twitter.com/btselem/status/1524346250530897926). 

AFAIK, this was only [reported on in the Israeli press \(Barak David wrote a report for Axios, but this part only appears in the Hebrew version\):](https://news.walla.co.il/item/3505547)

> חצי שעה אחרי הדיווחים הראשונים על מותה של אבו-עקלה, התקיימה התייעצות דחופה של מטה ההסברה הלאומי יחד עם נציגי משרד ראש הממשלה, משרד החוץ וצה""ל.
היעד המרכזי שנקבע היה לנסות ולהדוף את הנראטיב שהלך והתגבש, לפיו אבו-עאקלה נהרגה מאש ישראלית, ולנסות לשנות כותרות בכלי תקשורת בעולם שאימצו אותו.
לשם כך גויס סרטון וידאו קצר שצילמו חמושים פלסטינים הבוקר ובו הם נשמעים אומרים כי פגעו בחייל. כיוון שאף חייל לא נפגע באירוע, טענו בישראל שזו עדות לפגיעה באבו-עאקלה.
הסרטון הנסיבתי הזה בו כלל לא נראית אבו-עאקלה, אומץ על ידי ראש הממשלה בנט כדי לטעון בהודעה רשמית בעברית ובאנגלית שיש אפשרות שהעיתונאית נהרגה מירי פלסטיני.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry lied about the intentions behind posting the clip, tweeting:

> There was no claim that the gunfire in the clip killed journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Rather, that Palestinian terrorists were firing indiscriminately, and that they identified shooting down someone that looked to them like a soldier (ie, perhaps wearing a vest and helmet).

To which B'Tselem's Sarit Michaeli responded incredulously, pointing out that the Israeli government had added in subtitles:

> This statement is disingenuous and Feigns innocence. You tweeted a video and added subtitles to enhance your claim that this shooter hit someone (Shireen). So you locate the killing of Shireen in a specific point in space and time, but this is not the actual location.

* [Source.](https://twitter.com/saritm0/status/1524364090357043202)

The official Twitter for the Israeli embassy in the US, used the debunked video to cast blame on Palestinians:

> This video shows Palestinian terrorists, firing indiscriminately, and likely hitting Al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqla. A free and fair press is fundamental to Israel and all democracies, and as such journalists must be protected.

* [Archived link, because they deleted this tweet.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220511114409/https://twitter.com/IsraelinUSA/status/1524354459060555776)

While this was happening, the Israeli government seemingly called for a 'joint investigation' and accused the Palestinians of refusing - even though they hadn't actually asked the PA until later on.

>**It was only several hours after the initial Israeli statement on a joint probe into Abu Akleh's death during a military raid in Jenin that Foreign Minister Yair Lapid took up the matter with senior PA official Hussein al-Sheikh.**

* [Haaretz - Israel Proposed Joint Probe Into Journalist's Death, but Didn't Tell the Palestinians](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.HIGHLIGHT-israel-announces-joint-probe-was-rejected-before-making-an-offer-to-palestinians-1.10792830)

This became a common talking-point on social media. Pro-Israel commentators regularly emphasized the Palestinian 'refusal' to cooperate with Israel. 

However, as *Haaretz* noted - the PA intended to go to an independent third-party, the ICC.

#**[2] Desecrating her memory.** 

[Right after Abu Akleh died, the Israeli police went to her home to harass her family \(under the guise of a noise complaint\).](https://twitter.com/StefanieDekker/status/1524367184730136577)

Following the chaos at her funeral, in which [the police beat mourners](https://twitter.com/Rushdibbc/status/1525114366403743744) and [snatched Palestinian flags on her hearse](https://twitter.com/malonebarry/status/1525111238077841410), some articles gave the impression that the police were simply attempting to corral the procession back on track.

Namely a story published in WaPo that included one short line in which Abu Akleh's brother, says:

> But a group of men in the crowd prevented a hearse from backing up to the hospital door, saying they were intent on carrying her body on their shoulders. The standoff eventually prompted Akleh’s brother, sitting on a man’s shoulders, to beseech the crowd to let the hearse through. **“For God’s sake, let us put her in the car and finish the day,” he said.**

* [The Washington Post - Massive crowds, police beatings as journalist’s funeral is held in Jerusalem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/13/shireen-abu-akleh-al-jazeera-israel-jenin/)

Much like the talking-point about the Palestinian 'refusal' to cooperate with Israel, this line was widely-disseminated on social media as evidence of the Israeli police's good intentions.

Some pro-Israel commentators on social media attempted to re-frame the police violence as a response to Palestinian mourners 'kidnapping' Abu Akleh's casket.

The Israeli police continued to lie on social media, [including putting out a highly-edited & misleading video of the funeral violence.](https://twitter.com/rafaelshimunov/status/1525297760563609600)

However, [**Abu Akleh's brother himself gave his first-hand account, which unsurprisingly debunked the police version of events**](https://streamable.com/khrfvk) and summarily attributed the chaos to the police. Moreover, Abu Akleh explicitly stated that the funeral was not meant for the Abu Akleh family - it was meant for **all** Palestinians.

#**[3] Lies, lies, and more lies. The case of Yaser Murtaja.**

It's important to recall that the Israeli government also promoted lies about the killing of Palestinian medic, Rouzan al-Najjar, by an Israeli soldier. Much like other Palestinians killed by the Israeli army, the Israeli government tried to associate her with Hamas.

* [The Independent - Israeli army edits video of Palestinian medic its troops shot dead to misleadingly show she was 'human shield for Hamas'](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-protests-latest-idf-condemned-edited-video-angel-of-mercy-medic-razan-al-najjar-a8389611.html)

[Yaser Murtaja, a Palestinian journalist from Gaza](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/09/gaza-protest-yaser-murtaja-journalist-israel-palestine/), was also killed by an Israeli soldier - and again, the Israeli government (i.e. Avigdor Lieberman) spread baseless claims [**(ie that Murtaja was flying a drone above IDF to do surveillance for Hamas)**](https://twitter.com/ofirgendelman/status/983702737920675840) to deflect criticism & responsibility. 

[Lieberman never provided evidence that Murtaja was Hamas](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/04/11/601450534/slain-palestinian-journalists-colleagues-and-family-refute-israels-hamas-claim) and to this day, the claim has never been substantiated - even after the IDF closed the investigation into his death.

At the time, *Haaretz* noted that Lieberman provided no evidence.

> Lieberman provided no evidence to support his claims.

>[...]The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday that the media production company co-founded by Murtaja had recently received an $11,700 grant from the U.S. government.

* [Haaretz - Slain Gaza Journalist, Branded Hamas Militant by Israel, Received U.S. Grant](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2018-04-10/ty-article/gaza-journalist-branded-hamas-militant-by-israel-received-u-s-funds/0000017f-dc52-df62-a9ff-dcd739f90000)

Like other Israeli army 'investigations' - nothing was ever done about Murtaja's killing - and again, none of the bullshit claims spread by the Israeli government were substantiated.

[**In an interview between MSNBC news host Ayman Mohyeldin and on-the-ground reporter Raf Sanchez, Sanchez explained why the Palestinians don’t trust the Israelis to investigate Abu Akleh’s death:**](https://youtu.be/gYpBYLjrlHo?t=317)

> I was in Gaza; an Israeli sniper killed a young Palestinian journalist called Yaser Murtaja. He, like Shireen Abu Akleh, was wearing a vest that clearly showed he was a member of the press. That was four years ago. **The Israeli military said they were investigating then, and I asked them today to give me the report…. They sent me a very short statement saying that they had looked into the incident, they had determined that there was no criminal activity by any Israeli soldiers, and they had closed the case. That gives you a sense of why Palestinians feel that they are unlikely to get the full story out of the Israeli military.**


#**[4] Flag envy.**

Curiously, throughout the funeral chaos, Israeli police could be seen snatching Palestinian flags from attendees and even off of the hearse. This is not an uncommon thing to see, as [the police regularly do this at the Sheikh Jarrah protests - going so far as to injure Israeli protesters \(and even their mothers\).](https://i.imgur.com/c6iuVmm.gifv) 

 * [The Jerusalem Post - Police violence caught on camera at protest outside Sheikh Jarrah](https://archive.ph/Txa3h#selection-359.0-362.0)

Although - right now the Israeli government is seeking to criminalize the Palestinian flag to *some* extent.

#**[5] Don't let your memes be dreams.**

IDF Chief Aviv Kohavi claimed that Israeli soldiers don't ""deliberately"" attack journalists. Of course, that's a lie.

After desperately attempting to blame the Palestinians for Abu Akleh's death, the Israeli government began to rapidly change narratives - from suggesting either side could be responsible to saying it's possible that an Israeli soldier did it.

* [CBS News - Israel admits security forces may have killed Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shireen-abu-akleh-israel-security-forces/) 

Nevertheless the Israeli government settled on *not* conducting a criminal probe because, among other things, it might 'offend' the Israeli public.

> This time, however, the Military Advocate General, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, refrained from ordering a Metzah probe. The main reason for this is that there is no suspicion of a criminal act: The soldiers testified that they did not see the journalist at all and aimed their fire at gunmen, who were indeed nearby. **However, it seems that one of the reasons for the decision was the belief that such an investigation, which would necessitate questioning as potential criminal suspects soldiers for their actions during a military operation, would provoke opposition and controversy within the IDF and in Israeli society in general.**

>The Israeli right, in particular, has in recent years sharply criticized every case in which an investigation is opened against fighters. The decision not to open a criminal investigation, for which no official announcement has been made, is likely to provoke criticism from Washington, which has demanded that Israel investigate Abu Akleh’s death fully.

* [Haaretz - Israeli Military Will Not Conduct Criminal Probe Into Al Jazeera Reporter’s Death](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-military-will-not-conduct-criminal-probe-into-al-jazeera-reporter-s-death-1.10808866)

#**[6]** The investigations. 

In addition to *The Washington Post*, there have now been 3 other investigations about the killing of Abu Akleh.


* [**CNN** - 'They were shooting directly at the journalists': New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted attack by Israeli forces](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/middleeast/shireen-abu-akleh-jenin-killing-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html)

All investigations have come to the conclusion that an Israeli soldier likely killed Abu Akleh.

Just to summarize the CNN investigation (since that's the one I'm familiar with), here are the key points:

**[1]** Audio analysis of the gunfire establishes a distance of 177 to 197 meters away. 

* An adjacent tree, where Abu Akleh died nearby, bears the marks of the gunfire. CNN cites an expert who believes the tight-grouping of the shots imply intention/skill.

**[2]** One IDF armored vehicle is seen 3 min. prior to Shireen's killing, at about the same distance away AND in the same direction as the gunfire.

* Multiple videos from different angles are shown.

* Witnesses claim they were shot at from IDF in this direction.

**[3]** No Palestinian forces within relevant range.

* Palestinian forces were either further back and/or off to the side, out of line-of-sight of Abu Akleh.

The other investigations come to similar conclusions - including the WaPo report, which I skimmed. Important to note that they all establish that the IDF were closest to Shireen and the shot was fired from roughly 200 meters away, which happens to be where an IDF convoy was spotted prior to her killing.

#**[Conclusions]**

The purpose of this post was to provide historical background & context to explain why critics are skeptical of the Israeli government's narratives & of the usual accompanying hasbara. 

In the past, the Israeli government has lied about other human rights abuses. For example:

* [The Israeli government/army lies regarding the Qana massacre.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/uor3oh/very_well_said/i8gka51/)

* [Rabin's policy of 'breaking Palestinian protesters' bones'. In 1988, Israeli General Amnon Straschnow denied there was any policy to systematically abuse Palestinians. We now know this was EXACTLY the case. Then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the IDF to 'break the bones' of Palestinian protesters.](https://streamable.com/dkefsf)

Gaza only worsened and Israel did not respect the provisional measures issued by the Court in January, the ICJ sends now a strong message demanding Israel to abide with immediate effect with three provisions:

1 - ensure aid is distributed throughout all of Gaza. The measures outline that the required aid includes food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care.

2 - to open more land borders “including by increasing the capacity and number of land crossing points and maintaining them open for as long as necessary”.

3 - Israel to ensure “with immediate effect that its military does not commit acts which constitute a violation of any of the rights of the Palestinians in Gaza as a protected group” under the Genocide Convention. This includes “by preventing, through any action, the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance”.

One take-home message is, settler terrorism is a state’s policy, it is not just some sort of ‘uncontrolled’ behavior by individual settlers. These settlers are protected and supported by their equally terroristic occupation army, and are provided with weapons and tools to terrorize local Palestinians by the state (through BenGvir). Not only this, but also they are provided with 24/7 protection and support in their illegal terror outposts across the West Bank. These settlers are just an instrument that the Israeli army and state use to inflict harm and terror on Palestinian civilians and their property without bearing any responsibility.

It shows burnt out shells of cars but no crater that would be indicative of a JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition). In addition, the structural damage in the surrounding area appears to be quite low. As such it is likely that a misfired rocket hit the parking lot where numerous Palestinians were gathered and the high death toll was caused by shrapnel (likely ball bearings) added to rockets in order to increase their killing range.

* Specific details of the court systems added [can be found in this spreadsheet](https://judyrecords.com/uploads/new%20data%20sources%20-%202020-10-20%20-%20final.xlsx). These were added in the last couple months.

I just learned the database is being added to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners official training materials.

I'm incredibly stoked judyrecords will be listed alongside other proprietary databases like Lexis-Nexus, Experian and others, which are incredibly large data companies.

The data is 100% free to search.

osint,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/dp70jr/my_process_for_setting_up_anonymous_sockpuppet/,My process for setting up anonymous sockpuppet accounts.,"This is my process for setting up an anonymous sockpuppet account.

1. Come up with a persona for the sockpuppet account.
2. Use [Fake Name Generator](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) to create a person whom you feel fits your sockpuppet persona.
3. Use [This Person Does Not Exist](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/) to generate an image. Make sure you inspect the image closely and get one that doesn't have any obvious flaws, as they often do. It is worth picking up some Photoshop, GIMP, Affinity Photo or Designer, or other basic image manipulation skills to fix them and change the background of the image.
4. Get a burner phone, completely wiped and fresh. Can be any brand that will accept a Mint Mobile SIM card.
5. Get a burner credit card from [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/) to use for on Amazon and possible the Mint Mobile setup. They might need it to set up the account.
6. Set up a burner Amazon account. We're only going to use it once.
7. Buy two Mint Mobile SIM cards. You can find them various places online and in stores near you, but you can get two of them for $5 on Amazon. They also give you 1 week free trial with something like 100 text messages, which we're going to use. This gives you two cards for two sockpuppet accounts for only $5.
8. I like to use Amazon to have the card sent to an Amazon pickup box, which can be anonymous.
9. Get a VPN that you can set to the physical area in which you want your sockpuppet to ""exist.""
10. Set up the Mint Mobile trial account somewhere away from your home; as far as you're willing to go.
11. Use this Mint Mobile trial phone number to set up all of the websites you need.
12. I recommend at least set up a Google account and Protonmail account. Both will come in handy at different times.
13. Once you've set up all the accounts with your trial Mint SIM, set up 2FA on all of the accounts.
14. After setting up 2FA on all of the accounts, change the phone number to one you have more permanent access to, such as MySudo or Google Voice. 
15. Make sure everything works!
16. Destroy the SIM card.
17. Wipe the phone.

A lot of these websites are blocking MySudo, Google Voice, and other VoIP numbers. That's why we go through the Mint phone number first.

They should be less stringent now.

As always, feedback is welcome! This was originally posted on my blog where I also talk about the [ethics of sockpuppet accounts](https://garrettmickley.com/sockpuppet-account-creation/).",266,dp70jr,49,1572443482.0

For the past 13 years, I have been plagued with nightmares, anxiety, depression stemming from being aggressively cyber-stalked and other mysteries that have happened to me. Police never took it seriously, despite years of evidence. Because this person was more or less anonymous, they didn't care to look into who was the person behind the accounts. They didn't care about the threats, the hacking, the disturbing images and videos, etc. I seriously wish I was kidding, but alas, here I am.  


I was able to not only solve a 13 year old cyber stalker identity (in a different country!), I was also able to find people that to me seemingly 'vanished'. Using OSINT purely - I don't have a background in programming or hacking so the only thing I really had to use was my brain and what technology skills I did have.   


But I did it all, myself. Me. Little ol' me. The victim.

Never stop fighting for yourself.

It's been a while that I've been working with the Instagram's API. I found a way to access and scrape nearly all of their public data without any apparent limit rate.

I'm currently making a tool to score a network of users: see how close certain persons are based on their relationships (follower/following) and I was wondering if that sort of tool would help any of you? I was able to locate people with that and reconstruct friend networks.

As you can see on the image of the network around 9 persons that know each-other, we can easily find the people in-between them and make sure they know each-other and more!

I don't really need more than what I did with my script so if anybody needs something with it, I'd be glad to help for a couple of bucks 😅
Besides, if I see much interest, I'll sure make an online tool to help y'all, so let me know if you like it!

First of all, I gotta say that I have never heard about OSINT until a couple of days ago, and I’m not really good at tech in general. I’m a uni student (F20) and I went abroad for a weekend trip. Long story short: I met a really cool guy in a bar and since my phone was dead he gave me his number on a piece of paper. Next morning I wake up to an email on my university address (which I never use) that he accidentally gave me the wrong digits. I never gave him my last name (which is part of the email). I did tell him what uni I’m studying at but still, I have no idea how he got my email. I was busy and didn’t have time to reply for the whole day and I’m the evening he messaged me again, but on Facebook. Again, when we met he didn’t know my last name. From personal info he only know my hometown, university and what I’m studying. When I replied and jokingly asked him if he’s a hacker he said that he’s into hacking and osint. And then he radndomly stopped replying to me. He’s account is definitely fake coz it was created like a few days ago. That’s why I’m here.

Using the google ‘site:’ operator, we’ll perform an image search inside [Facebook.com](https://Facebook.com), and search for the words or actions we want – site:facebook.com “image may contain X” (inside google image searches)

For example – ‘site:facebook.com “image may contain boarding pass to new york”‘ will return pictures of boarding passes on Facebook that contains ‘new york’. Change “boarding pass to new york” with any other phrases, nouns, and verbs and you’ll get the images with these words in the captions.

In some cases, searching without “image may contain” will also work O.K. 

You can also search for certain people, furniture, fruit, objects, and so on, and get images that match these criteria. For example – site:facebook.com “image may contain 16 people”

Normal people don't say ""stakeholder engagement"" when they seek for lobbyists, or do you?

The ""AI Search Whisperer"" tool transforms standard search inquiries into detailed, technical phrases to more effectively locate specific information. On top of that I scripted advanced search techniques, often referred to as Google Dorks, to enhance the search process . Because I wrote it for my students of Walter Cronkite in Phoenix, it provides explanations for its search strategies.

If you would type ""reasons for not following the law"", it will take you seriously. It will try to find hidden gems that are written by experts who never use the keywords you just used. When looking for reasons for not complying with the law, it's essential to use terms that are likely to appear in legal, educational, or bureaucratic texts. Phrases such as ""non-compliance"", ""legal violations"", ""regulatory non-adherence"", or ""circumventing laws"" are more likely to yield relevant documents. AI Search Whisperer will use a combination of these terms along with Google search operators to refine the results.

You can throw more complicated stuff at it like ACARS codes (easter egg!), reasons for dementia, how do I find secret lobbyists for hydrogen in the UK or  car incident research methods. The tool sucks for simple queries like best pizza or nearest cinema.

To avoid hallucinations, I used  GPT-4 Turbo with 128K context (not available via ChatGPT chat interface, only via API) and with a cold temperature to get strict answers.  I tried other LLM's - they all failed on me. 

The virtual research assistant is at version 0.11 so highly experimental. It would be great if you give me some feedback so I can finetune the tool.

Some tips:

\- Regardless your topic, you get 20 highly optimized search queries: 8 for Google, 1 for Perplexity,  3 for video websites, 2 for podcasts, 1 for Bing and 1 for Brave.  The video suggestions and podcast suggestions often don't make any sense when your topic is very detailed like ""green cows with red hats"". In a next version I'll try to train the LLM to shut up earlier.

\- It only finds what is real. So ""how do I become a millionaire in a week"" it will say ""The query ""how do I become a millionaire in a week"" is quite unlikely to yield legitimate results because becoming a millionaire in such a short time frame is not typically feasible through conventional means. However, I can provide you with search suggestions that might lead to content discussing quick wealth generation, albeit with a critical and realistic perspective.""

If you ask: ""My parents blocked my internet access. How do I get rid of the block?"", it will do its best for you, check [https://ibb.co/TWy528Y](https://ibb.co/TWy528Y)  because that information is out there.

\- if the tool misinterprets your question, there is no way yet to stop it hallucinating, working on that

\- it's still rather slow. opening up takes 20-30 seconds. the tool stops babbling after 2 minutes

\- the best way to understand what the tool actually does: type **reasons for dementia,**  see [https://ibb.co/Q6xzsvd](https://ibb.co/Q6xzsvd)

Requests:

\- I didn't train it especially on #osint, but please do try and let me know if it's get silly, will try to change the prompts and training models

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to the gathering and analysis of information obtained from publicly accessible sources, including online and offline sources such as the Internet, traditional media, academic publications, photos and videos, geo-spatial information, and more. OSINT is valuable for investigations because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation demands compared to other forms of intelligence, provides a rich variety of perspectives, and can serve as a foundation for comprehending classified material. OSINT can also protect sources and methods in intelligence assessments.

 ""INTRODUCTION TO OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

A Brief History: The exact origin of the term OSINT is unclear, but the concept of obtaining intelligence through publicly accessible resources has likely existed for centuries. During World War II, various nations' security agencies began incorporating OSINT into their intelligence strategies. In recent times, with the rapid expansion of internet communications and the proliferation of digital information generated by the public, OSINT has become an indispensable tool for numerous organizations, including government departments, NGOs, and corporations, who increasingly rely on open-source information as opposed to classified or confidential data. ""

OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence because they must be legally accessible by the public without breaching any copyright or privacy laws. This distinction makes the ability to gather OSINT sources applicable to more than just security services. For example, businesses can benefit from exploiting these resources to gain intelligence about their competitors.

# How is OSINT used by investigators and law enforcement?

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is used by investigators and law enforcement to gather information from publicly available sources, such as the internet, media outlets, and social networks. This information can then be analyzed and used to support investigations, to build a profile of individuals or organizations, to gather intelligence about criminal or terrorist activities, or to help track down suspects. Examples of OSINT sources include public databases, social media posts, news articles, satellite imagery, and forums. By leveraging the vast amounts of information available through open sources, investigators and law enforcement can more effectively gather the information they need to perform their duties.

""Utilization of OSINT by Investigators and Law Enforcement: OSINT encompasses a vast array of publicly accessible information sources. This information can be located both online and offline, including but not limited to:

\-The internet, such as forums, blogs, social media, video-sharing platforms, wikis, Whois records of registered domains, metadata and digital files, resources within the dark web, geolocation data, IP addresses, people search engines, and all other information retrievable online. -Conventional mass media such as television, radio, newspapers, books, and magazines. -Specialized journals, academic publications, dissertations, conference proceedings, company profiles, annual reports, company news, employee profiles, and résumés. -Photos, videos, and associated metadata. -Geospatial information, such as maps and commercial imagery products.""

# [https://www.secjuice.com/introduction-to-open-source-intelligence-osint/](https://www.secjuice.com/introduction-to-open-source-intelligence-osint/)

Open-source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, (Intel community) the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. A notable example relates to terrorism, where open-source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.

Open-source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open-source reporting. This can prove useful when policy-makers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.

""Value of OSINT: OSINT is prized for its reduced processing and exploitation demands compared to more technical intelligence disciplines like HUMINT, SIGINT, MASINT, and GEOINT. Additionally, the vast array of sources covered by OSINT provides a rich array of perspectives.

Supplementing Classified Information: Open-source information serves as a foundation for comprehending classified material. Despite the abundance of classified information produced by the Intelligence Community, the quantity of classified information available for a specific topic may be limited and can lack context if only viewed through a classified lens. For instance, in the realm of terrorism, OSINT can bridge gaps and create connections to enhance analysts' understanding of fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist schemes, possible attack modes, and potential targets.

Protection of Sources and Methods: In some cases, an intelligence assessment informed by sensitive, classified information can be justified on the basis of open-source reporting. This can be advantageous when policymakers must explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.""

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to the gathering and analysis of information obtained from publicly accessible sources, including online and offline sources such as the Internet, traditional media, academic publications, photos and videos, geospatial information, and more. OSINT is valuable for investigations because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation demands compared to other forms of intelligence, provides a rich variety of perspectives, and can serve as a foundation for comprehending classified material. OSINT can also protect sources and methods in intelligence assessments.

# Phases of the OSINT Process;

Refined OSINT Information Gathering Process

OSINT is a crucial aspect of the Reconnaissance phase of hacking and the collected information is carried forward into the Enumeration phase. With the immense amount of data available on the web, it is essential for attackers to have a structured search framework and an array of OSINT collection tools to aid in the task and avoid being overwhelmed by the information present on the internet.

The OSINT reconnaissance process can be further divided into the following five sub-phases:

Source Identification: As the first step, the attacker identifies potential sources from which information can be collected. These sources are documented in detailed notes for future reference, if required.

Data Harvesting: In this phase, the attacker collects and harvests information from the selected sources and any other sources that are discovered during this phase.

Data Processing and Integration: In this phase, the attacker processes the harvested information to gather actionable intelligence by searching for relevant information that may aid in the investigation.

Data Analysis: In this phase, the attacker analyzes the processed information using OSINT analysis tools.

Results Delivery: In the final phase, the OSINT analysis is complete and the findings are presented or reported to the members of the Red Team.

From fighting back at scammers, to finding missing people, to helping victims of phishing. I should clarify, that a lot of this is going to come off as hard to believe. And while I have receipts for a lot of it, I can't show them, a lot of the people I've worked with are huge on privacy (of course) and don't want their information shared. So I'll provide receipts and evidence when I can.   

Stage 1. - The Noob  
I first started learning about OSINT just before my first year of college, but I didn't know it was called OSINT at the time. I had seen examples of OSINT from YouTube videos made by people like Jim Browning and Scambaiter, but I didn't know how any of it worked. As I started my first year of college, I learned about Tracelabs from a story on YouTube. After I learned about TraceLabs, I decided to get involved and learn how to do this. So I went on their website, joined a few boards, and started learning all the tools that people used, and learned a good investigative approach. I learned how I could take a single data point, like a username or email, and run it through different looks like Ghunt, Maigret, Dehashed, etc to gain troves of information about an individual. I learned about different image and facial recognition tools, from as basic as Google Images, to Pimeyes, to doing it myself with basic AI facial recognition software. It was an incredibly enlightening experience. I learned from a lot of really smart people, but I never really made a name for myself in this community, as I wasn't interested in the gamified portion of it, I was just interested in helping people. So not being able to see if my work was actually resulting in missing people being found, was incredibly discouraging and eventually, I moved on.  


Stage 2. - Branching Out and Making Friends  
So like I said before, I had seen videos from YouTubers like Jim Browing and Scambaiter, and I knew that I could actually help them using my newly gained skills. So, I decided to try to get in contact with Scambaiter, because he was less popular at the time, and I thought I had a better chance of working with him than Jim Browning.   


Of course just to get in contact with him, I needed to prove I was worth his time, so I found the real-life details of a member of his behind-the-scenes team, to prove that my OSINT skills could be useful in finding scammers who had good OpSEC. During this process, I learned that Scambaiter, just like Jim Browning, has an entire group of amateur hackers, security professionals, and researchers like myself who help them behind the scenes. Nobody really knows about this, because it's not apparent in the videos. But there are a ton of people who do a lot of heavy lifting for YouTubers like Scambaiter and Jim Browning. This isn't to diminish what these YouTubers do, it's just to say that sometimes I wish the people behind the scenes got credit too. Regardless, it was an incredible experience, I met a lot of really really smart and talented people, who I am still friends with to this day.

I did end up moving away from the scambaiting community though, mostly because of a lot of scandals that happened behind the scenes. Unfortunately, most of them never ended up getting exposed to the public. Things like people stealing gift cards from victims, and generally just being super-shady and awful. Either way, I learned a lot and made lifelong friends. Those friends have become huge supports for me and many are doing amazing things now! I wish I could say more, but I'm going to respect their privacy.  


Stage 3. - Going out on my own  
After these two experiences, I ended up helping a family member after their Facebook account had been hacked. This ultimately led to my research into a phishing scam, which led to me exposing a cybercrime gang responsible for stealing what I believe to be millions of Facebook accounts over the past decade or so. I then sold this story to Cybernews, who's published it and I am currently working with some translators to help me communicate with the Dominican Republic CERT team and police, to actually bring justice to the victims.  


Finally, I'd just like to say, that the internet is full of awful people, who for far too long have hidden behind their monitors and gotten away with so much. And for a long time, there was nothing anyone could do, but now with the power of OSINT, we can finally unmask these awful people and bring justice to their victims. So if you want to be a part of that, I'd really suggest learning OSINT, it's not going to change your life, but it could change somebody else's.

EDIT: Update, I was hired by a PI firm after posting this, this journey isn't over yet.

osint,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/1cmwkwf/i_have_a_fever_and_the_only_cure_is_building_more/,I have a fever. And the only cure is building more OSINT tools.,"I have built over a dozen OSINT related tools recently. Most of which are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/devbret). 

My point is that I have whetted my thirst for something greater. So I am turning to you all for challenges.

> What kinds of OSINT programs can I build for this community?

Give me your best shot. But remember that the ideal suggestion is something that can be run locally, on someone's computer.

**Edit One:**

Here is [a perfect example](https://github.com/devbret/keyword-monitoring-to-csv) of what I am doing for fun now.

**Edit Two:**

Tonight I also made a serious update to the UI of [my GeoSpy API application on GitHub](https://github.com/devbret/geospy-api-mapping). It's worth checking out IMO.

And here is [a quick video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/6phQE0MY_ak) of what this application can now do.

This is [what the app looks like now](https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/bernhoftbret/geospy-web-app-screenshot.png). (*roughly twelve hours after the above links in edit two were shared*)

**Edit Three:**

This is exciting. From the comments, I can see a number of good opportunities for developing something awesome. I'm thinking that I would like to collaborate with another, already ongoing OSINT project/resource. Thank you for your encouragement. FOSS is the way to go; generally speaking.

""*If everyone's digging for gold, sell shovels.*""

**Edit Four:**

The next stage of maturity for these projects is to start hosting them, and making the services available to the world. More on that to come soon.

**Edit Five:**

Here is [an underutilized tool](https://github.com/devbret/detailed-audio-analysis) that I developed for analyzing, visualizing and comparing different metrics with and among as many .MP3 and .WAV files as you can process and stand to look at.

You might be surprised what sound looks like, as measured and displayed over time.

**Edit Six:**

Here's [another set of tools](https://github.com/devbret/pihole-data-measurement-tools) that I have developed, for analyzing and visualizing data from your own Pi-hole DNS logs.

I seriously have like two or three dozen prod-ready programs that OSINT folks would likely find helpful. The problem is choosing which ones to take seriously.

**Edit Seven:**

I decided to do something with the CLI more specifically and primarily. So here is a Python script ([on GitHub](https://github.com/devbret/domain-and-ip-analyses), with instructions and an easy install) that makes fourteen various, rather revealing checks on a website domain and/or IP address.",111,1cmwkwf,88,1715144734.0

We award free badges to anyone who goes through the program and completes all of the requirements for each of the levels. We also have a resources list which is growing by the day, and have different OSINT tools and resources categorized to make finding them easier.

And if you fancy testing your skills, the OSINT Dojo also regularly posts their own OSINT challenges, as well as shares other OSINT challenges via our Twitter page ([www.twitter.com/osintdojo](https://www.twitter.com/osintdojo)).

While this is just a fun side project, we are hoping to improve it as much as we can, and are open to any ideas or suggestions that the r/OSINT community might have as well!",106,kgew5d,10,1608407452.0

I hope you are all doing well. Last week I posted on here about an app I built to find tweets based on location ([birdhunt.co](https://birdhunt.co/)). **I wanted to thank you all for the support and the feedback** I have been getting. I have added a lot of features to it recently and want to continue to develop it!

This weekend I started a new project to try and replicate [birdhunt.co](https://birdhunt.co/) but with Instagram. It's a little trickier than I initially thought but I hope it's useful to some of you guys.

**The new tool is** [**instahunt.co**](https://instahunt.co/)

It gives you the ability to map Instagram ""places"" and find posts near your selected location.

Due to it being a little bit more complex it's **desktop only** for the time being. I would love to make this mobile-friendly in the future though. **It also requires an Instagram account** to use.

The actual tool is more complex so I would love your feedback on how you find using it. Additionally, I would love to hear about any features/ideas you have about what to add next!",107,srspi5,13,1644785686.0

The German state is doing its best to suppress any pro-Palestinian voices to make it look like the population is standing behind its genocidal antics. While I‘m sure part of the German population is in support of the war, I personally think a large majority simply don’t care or don’t want to speak up (in classic German bystander tradition). But especially among the younger generation there are many who do care and I felt the need to show you that hope isn’t lost for all of us. Free Palestine 🇵🇸 from Germany!

Since the genocide began, I started going to a lot of protests against the occupation and genocide of Palestinians. (Organized by ""Radical Bloc TLV"" & ""Free Jerusalem"" on Instagram)
I found a group of Anti-Zionist friends there and we go to protests together when we can.
But It just doesn't feel enough... These protests are only met with curses, dirty looks and police violence.
The last protest I went to faced extreme violence from the police and 4 were arrested for doing nothing but holding signs against the genocide, and one photographer who just did his job taking pictures.
I have heard some people say individuals like me should take militant action against the IOF, but I'm only 19 and I'm not sure I can do that at all, others said I should leave completely because if I'm not helping to fight from ""the belly of the beast"" then I'm just another useless settler.
I don't know what to do, every day I walk outside, there's Israeli flags everywhere and it makes me depressed and hopeless, seeing their propaganda (""Together we'll win"") makes me angry and frustrated.
I thought maybe I can at the very least try to meet Palestinians in occupied Jerusalem and be their friend... help them feel better about the situation somehow, knowing there's Anti-Zionist Israelis like me out there.",3603,1btdf3e,444,1712000497.0

Because somewhere down the road of history some bastard will get up and say that this never happened.” -Dwight D. Eisenhower (1945),"To the mods & everyone else complaining or downvoting graphic images:

Please stop. We need the footage. We need it out there. 

Not because we want our family members turned into a gore/snuff film. Not because we want a phone filled with images of our own dead. Not because it isn’t against Jewish law to desecrate a corpse in these ways. 


Because without evidence, we’re called liars. Because even with all the damn evidence, we’re still called liars. 


PLEASE recognize how hard we’re trying to show the world what’s really happening. 

**Additionally: Please recognize the numbers here. Every single Jew in this world doesn’t even amount to half of most celebrity Instagram follower counts. We can’t fight an algorithm that’s tripped every time our posts are downvoted to hell. Please help share. If you can’t, please heart/like something on Instagram/Facebook/X to help negate all the reports on those that are speaking out. It’s the one time a like really makes a difference.**


Our private messages on all social media platforms are filled with death threats, but that doesn’t matter as much as all of our attempts to share proof getting shadow banned. There’s a reason everyone was on team #freepalestine & are getting shocking awakenings from this new data. We cannot do this ourselves. We don’t have enough voices. 

Please lend your eyes and hearts to our victims, and lend your voice to make sure they’re seen.
