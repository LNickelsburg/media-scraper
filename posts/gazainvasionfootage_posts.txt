I made this community to narrow down combat footage of the ground invasion into one area. So many of the Israel-Palestine conflict subs have too many news stories/polarized. I would like to make this sub the hub for finding footage of the ground invasion and the conflict that ensues. Please try not to flood the sub with airstrike videos as they are pretty redundant and every other sub has them already (but some will be allowed as long as they dont drown out other footage). Please post any new footage you find I really appreciate it. Footage of combat related to the region are also allowed now. That means clashes in other countries directly inspired or caused by the Gaza invasion.\n\nBattles outside Gaza and on the sea are allowed.\n\nApparently HAMAS POV videos are banned on Reddit? I’m not sure what exactly is allowed and what isn’t so not sure how to proceed with that in the sub. Pretty lame if we’re only aloud to post the Israeli POV of the invasion.', 24, 11)
