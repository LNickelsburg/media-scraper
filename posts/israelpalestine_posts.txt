In following for the past two decades since my teens, this is perhaps the most disturbed I've felt and I think it has to do with the scale. A few points:\n\n1) Hamas committed a terrible tragedy. This was a massacre of civilians. I feel for the Israelis who lost loved ones and others held captive. Seeing the body count of Israeli civilians climbing was like a continuing punch in the gut. I always knew Hamas was ruthless, and did not see them capable of caring this out on such a horrendous scale.\n\n2) For every Israeli civilian killed, I know there will be 10 civilians in Gaza killed by the end of this. Israel has no choice but to respond in great force. This will be on the largest scale Gaza has ever seen. The sinking feeling of seeing the Israeli civilian deaths is now paired with the anxiety of the coming destruction in Gaza.\n\n3) I knew there were no prospects going forward in the conflict. This will just further cement things. The far-right on both sides will be strengthened. This is a gift for Netanyahu who will stay in power. Hamas know Israel will respond in great force, and doesn't care because it furthers their cause of blaming Israel. Both sides are abhorrent.\n\n4) Moderates on both sides will be pushed to the right by the end of this. Israelis are rightfully horrified about the massacre and murder committed by Hamas but will blame the Palestinians as a whole for complacency/support of Hamas. Palestinians continue to be brutalized by the occupation and will become increasingly desperate and resentful of Israelis, especially in Gaza. I see the occupation only getting worse going forward.\n\n5) The next generation of Palestinians will be just as resentful and more prone to Hamas-like propaganda blaming Israel for everything. Whatever happens will die down eventually and just repeatedly boil over into rounds of violence.\n\n6) Regarding the current dialogue: I am frustrated by those who are uninformed about the conflict blaming Palestinians/Muslims for everything with really no understanding of the last 50 years of occupation.

In a two-hour interview outside a cafe in southern Israel, she recounted seeing groups of heavily armed gunmen rape and kill at least five women...at 8 a.m. on Oct. 7, she was hiding under the low branches of a bushy tamarisk tree, just off Route 232, about four miles southwest of the party. She had been shot in the back...felt faint...covered herself in dry grass and lay as still as she could. About 15 meters from her hiding place she saw motorcycles, cars and trucks pulling up. She saw about 100 men, most of them dressed in military fatigues and combat boots, a few in dark sweatsuits, getting in and out of the vehicles. The men congregated along the road and passed between them assault rifles, grenades, small missiles — and badly wounded women. “It was like an assembly point.” **The first victim she saw** was a young woman with copper-color hair, blood running down her back, pants pushed down to her knees. One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back....While one terrorist raped her, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast.....“One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,”....the men sliced her face and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same time, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three more women....Yura Karol, a 22-year-old security consultant, said he was hiding in the same spot, and he can be seen in one of Sapir’s photos.... In an interview, Mr. Karol said he barely lifted his head to look at the road but he also described seeing a woman raped and killed.\n* Raz Cohen....saw five men, wearing civilian clothes, all carrying knives and one carrying a hammer, dragging a woman across the ground. She was young, naked and screaming. “They all gather around her,” Mr. Cohen said. “She’s standing up. They start raping her. I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words.” “Then one of them raises a knife,” he said, “and they just slaughtered her.” Shoam Gueta, one of Mr. Cohen’s friends and a fashion designer, said the two were hiding together in the streambed. He said he saw at least four men step out of the van and attack the woman, who ended up “between their legs.” He said that they were “talking, giggling and shouting,” and that one of them stabbed her with a knife repeatedly, “literally butchering her.”\n* Yinon Rivlin, a member of the rave’s production team who lost two brothers in the attacks, said that after hiding from the killers, he emerged from a ditch and made his way to the parking area, east of the party, along Route 232, looking for survivors. Near the highway, he said, he found the body of a young woman, on her stomach, no pants or underwear, legs spread apart. He said her vagina area appeared to have been sliced open, “as if someone tore her apart.”\n* Captain Maayan asked to be identified only by her rank and surname because of the sensitivity of the subject. She said she had seen several bodies with cuts in their vaginas and underwear soaked in blood and one whose fingernails had been pulled out.\n* **There are at least three women and one man who were sexually assaulted and survived**, according to Gil Horev, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. “None of them has been willing to come physically for treatment,” he said.

The population of Lod did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the 10 to 15 miles to the point where they met up with the legion." - Yitzhak Rabin\n\nIn “0 Jerusalem,” Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre described “a calculated Israeli policy” to drive Arab residents from their homes, and they confirmed reports by some survivors that many elderly people and small children died in the overpowering heat during the forced march.\n\n"Contingents of the extremist Stern gang and Irgun attacked the village and lined men, women and children up against walls and shot them, according to Red Cross and British documentation."\n\n"A major expulsion took place at Qisarya, south of Haifa, where Palestinian Arabs were evicted and their houses destroyed on 19–20 February 1948. In attacks that were not authorised in advance, several communities were expelled by the Haganah and several others were chased away by the Irgun."" - Benny Morris\n\n"During the "long seminar", a meeting of Ben-Gurion with his chief advisors in January 1948, the main point was that it was desirable to "transfer" as many Arabs as possible out of Jewish territory, and the discussion focussed mainly on the implementation...Plan Dalet was the master plan for the expulsion of the Palestinians." - Ilan Pappe\n\nAccording to Morris, "The Haganah mortar attacks of 21–22 April [on Haifa] were primarily designed to break Arab morale in order to bring about a swift collapse of resistance and speedy surrender. [...] But clearly the offensive, and especially the mortaring, precipitated the exodus. The three-inch mortars "opened up on the market square [where there was] a great crowd [...] a great panic took hold. The multitude burst into the port, pushed aside the policemen, charged the boats and began to flee the town", as the official Haganah history later put it". According to Pappé, this mortar barrage was deliberately aimed at civilians to precipitate their flight from Haifa.\n\n"The orders of Carmeli\'s 22nd Battalion were "to kill every Arab encountered" and to set alight with fire-bombs "all objectives that can be set alight."\n\nIsraeli vans with loudspeakers drove through the streets ordering all the inhabitants to evacuate immediately, and such as were reluctant to leave were forcibly ejected from their homes by the triumphant Israelis whose policy was now openly one of clearing out all the Arab civil population before them... From the surrounding villages and hamlets, during the next two or three days, all the inhabitants were uprooted and set off on the road to Ramallah... No longer was there any "reasonable persuasion". Bluntly, the Arab inhabitants were ejected and forced to flee into Arab territory...

Israel is the indigenous homeland of the Jewish People. The Jewish people have existed in that land for 3000 years. You will find Jewish graves from that time period, Jewish artifacts in the ground. The cities that exist are all Jewish names. Israel lives  and breathes Jewish History. \n\n2.) Judaism was the first Abrahamic religion they just want to mind their own business in their little land, they don’t proselytize and are not interested and were never interested in conquering or converting anyone. They just want to live in peace. \n\n3.) Jewish people have always wanted to go back to their homeland. They have been expelled from it by many empires, had their temples destroyed. Yet they kept up this hope for 2000 years. Every Passover they would say “ Next Year In Jerusalem” \n\n4.) Jewish people have been massacred and prosecuted in every single diaspora community they have lived in for simply being Jewish. There is no other community in the history of humanity that has been prosecuted for their religion like the Jews have. \n\n5.) Jewish people are resilient they went through so much trauma and have found ways to survive. I admire them as a Muslim woman because I can understand being confronted with so much bigotry and barriers against you. \n\n6.) Jewish people are progressive and they support many progressive movements such as the civil rights movement, women’s rights movement, they also stand up for other minorities who are being prosecuted for their religion and their ethnicity. \n\n7.) Jewish people have helped me. When I emigrated to the US as a refugee. Jewish American organizations helped me with clothes, resources. I also have a lot of Jewish friends and co-workers who are the one of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met. \n\n8.) Israel is a country and just like every other country they make mistakes. We can criticize the policies of Israel and not wish for Israel’s destruction. Muslims and Arabs have killed way more Muslims/ Arabs than Israel ever has. No one has ever wanted to wipe Syria or Iraq off the map for the actions of those governments but everyone wants to wipe Israel off the map. \n\n9.) if Israel ceases to exist this will put Jews worldwide in danger. Everyone dislikes Jews and wants to murder them. Israel is essential for Jewish safety. \n\n10.) Israel tries to make peace with its neighbors. Since the inception of Israel they have tried to have a seat at the table with its neighbors but they have all tried destroying Israel. \n\nTo conclude this post, Israel and the Jewish people are not the monsters they are made out to be. They are humans just like us and they make mistakes but denying their right to exist in their homeland is cruel knowing their history.', 405, 196)

As a Palestinian this all makes me ANGRY! Hamas did these attacks knowing Israel would strike back with great force and they prepared themselves for it but not the “people they’re fighting for”.

Like, what? In fact, my brother also told me this the other day. Where did you get this history lesson from? I hear this kind of saintly polishing of Palestinian history a lot. So... we ran some humanitarian effort to save the Jews from the Holocaust? Lol. I saved several screenshots of such comments, but unfortunately, image attachments aren\'t enabled in this sub.\n\xa0\n\nA foreign power ruled over our people (Britain) and forced mass immigration into our land at the time. Our people got violent. It\'s understandable that they revolted and were unaccepting of immigrants flooding into their land led by a foreign colonial power, especially when they were expecting sovereignty from the British like our Arab neighbors got.\n\n\nThen I see channels like Middle East Eye recounting the events that led to the conflict; they start with the Belfour declaration and then just skip to the Nakba. We\'re just going to skip 30 years of back-and-forth violence that led to the \'48 war. It was a war, by the way, that we lost badly. The Jews didn\'t wake up one day and barge into every Palestinian home to kick them out.\n\n\nHowever, it seems any honest recount of history or critique of Palestinian history gets met with me being called a traitor. I\'m just saying that our people back in the 1900s acted like any community would if a foreign power forced societal changes on them. There\'s no reason to paint us as saints.\n\xa0\n\nJust please stop recreating history, and maybe actually read the history. This conflict\'s history isn\'t simply a matter of good guys versus bad guys; it\'s more nuanced than that.', 391, 269)

('https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ak1bdd/palestine_is_ruining_the_left/', 'Palestine is Ruining the Left', 'I\'m an Israeli-American leftist who has been active in American and Israeli politics for a number of years now. I have always advocated for human rights, equity, and self-determination for Palestinians who are oppressed(to different extents) under Israel, a nation that commits itself to Jewish domination of institutions. I always voted and campaigned for progressive Democrats and I assisted with the Israeli Meretz party from abroad. This is why I think the current Palestinian-sympathetic movement is ruining the left:\n\n1. **Abandonment of Pragmatism** \\- Just like the 2020 George Floyd protests("Defund the Police"), the Western left has completely embraced a suicidal strategy of idealistic radicalism. Many of those on the left insist the solution to the conflict is a one-state solution consisting of Palestine "from the River to the Sea". Unfortunately, they\'ve appropriated the Palestinian mythology in their ambitions to magically destroy Israel and the ideology of Zionism by BDS somehow or supporting Palestinian "armed struggle". It doesn\'t take a lot of thought to see how both of those methods are incredibly ineffective and immoral to advocate for and implement. So, instead of a pragmatic approach, like empowering the Israeli left through donations and advocacy, supporting a reasonable solution(two-state or one-state under Israel), or calling for the ultimate humanitarian end to the war of a unilateral Hamas surrender, the Western left insists on a dream scenario that will never happen. This is the most egregious behavior of the left and it\'s their most common mistake(i.e. Vietnam). This is due to the fact that Palestinians, especially in Gaza, are suffering under disproportionate Israeli force with no Western movement to realistically end it. In fact, these Western leftists, due to these tactics, are assisting in empowering and legitimizing the far-right of Israel. They are the perfect strawman to turn people off to the left in Israel, which, in turn, results in a lengthened Palestinian suffering.\n2. **Maximalism** \\- There\'s a tendency on the left to outcompete each other in radicalism. It\'s not catchy or sexy to say "The war tactics that Israel uses are disproportionate and don\'t consider enough of the humanitarian cost", it has to be "genocide" or "ethnic cleansing" in order to provoke an emotional reaction from uneducated Westerners. It\'s not "the security policy of Hafradah has resulted in reduced human rights of Palestinians compared to Israelis", it has to be "Apartheid"(with the only legal precedent being South Africa). These maximalist statements immeasurably hurt the movement for true progress on Palestinian human rights. It results in a boy-who-cried-wolf situation: If Israel decides to transfer the entire Gazan population to the Sinai, what is that called? A "genocide"? Due to the present labeling of the war, nobody will believe it. What if Israel permanently transfers or kills 100,000 Palestinian civilians? 200,000? 1 million? What will that be called? How can it get worse than "genocide"? This Maximalist rhetoric is not only inaccurate, but it\'s incredibly damaging to describe the proportionate extent of Palestinian suffering, which is vital to any movement that faithfully advocates for an upliftment of Palestinian life and identity.\n3. **Normalization of Bigotry** \\- Explicit or latent Jew-Hatred is being increasingly embraced by radical sections of the Western left. Tropes such as "Zionist"(a euphemism for "Jew" for many) control of governments or blood libel. Wishing "Death to Zionists" or equating them with Nazis is, in most cases, latent Jew-Hatred. Regardless of your thoughts on the definition of Zionism(there is no definition, it is a meaningless term), it\'s clear that many believe that "Zionists" are just uppity Jews. Of course, this is genuinely believed by a small portion of the left. However, a substantial part of Western leftists has repeatedly failed to condemn this Jew-Hatred and to stop mirroring the language of these latent or explicit Jew-Haters. This is 1000x worse in the case of Israelis. For Western leftists, it\'s normal to call Israelis "colonizers", "demons", "rapists", and "child-murderers" on their social media without repercussion or introspective irony. As somebody belonging to the Israeli nationality, I have been desensitized to the insane amount of bigotry from those that I formerly respected. However, many Israelis or Jews aren\'t as depersonalized as I am, and they definitely take the bigotry to heart. What do you think results from that? Usually, a vote for Likud(Netanyahu\'s Party) or a donation to AIPAC. Thus, propagating a cycle of bigotry and continuing the suffering of Palestinians.\n4. **Propaganda** \\- This war has sparked the largest disinformation campaigns in human history. Multiple state entities (Israel, U.S., Russia, Iran, Qatar) and numerous private entities are pumping out loads of propaganda in order to manipulate uneducated Westerners into supporting their interests. Since October 7th, known Russian disinformation propagator, Jackson Hinkle, has skyrocketed in followers due to his ability to mislead Western leftists on the war. I have seen an unfathomable amount of reposts from Al Jazeera and MiddleEastEye, known Qatari state propaganda and major propagates of misinformation. I have always appreciated the value of institutional skepticism that embodied many of the historical and academic leftist leaders. However, right now, those values are completely thrown out in favor of Russia or Iran\'s geopolitical advocacy of "everything the West does is bad". The previous three points of behavior are certainly emboldened by the paid disinformation and bots that propagate anti-Western sentiment to destabilize Western democracy. Meanwhile, the basic interests of Palestinian civilians are left unregarded while these state operatives kill their only lifeline.\n5. **Reactionary Resurgence** \\- One of the main factors that attracted me to the left was its rejection of reactionary ideology(the establishment of traditional institutions from the past). For Israelis and Palestinians, reactionary rhetoric is normalized and encouraged in many cases. However, this reactionary ideology that has plagued those who share my nationality has spread to Western leftists in their advocacy for Palestine. Western leftists constantly appropriate the far-right and reactionary talking points that many radicalized Palestinians spout. An example would be the insistence on the exclusive indigeneity of Palestine from the River to the Sea, which abandons the progressive values of anti-nationalism and intersectionality. Another example would be the appropriation of Palestinian Martyrdom, in which many of them embraced the idea that human life can be inherently reduced to a political or national cause by their manner of death. This is a clear rejection of the values of individualism, secularism, and anti-nationalism.\n6. **Historical Negligence** \\- Those who are even a little bit informed on the Israel-Palestinian Conflict understand that the conflict is too complex to be treated as a soccer match of Israelis vs. Palestinians. Many Israeli and Palestinian leaders set roadblocks to an equitable peace, while many others progressed the conflict to a more positive state. Even more than the historical complexity of this conflict, evaluating the moral complexity requires a graduate degree in a relevant field with hundreds of hours of research. I typically advise not to trust anybody\'s commentary of the conflict with any less credibility than the previous sentence. However, the Western left has instead decided to follow the historical and moral analysis of demagogues. There\'s constantly factually wrong or misleading historical information on many of these Palestinian-sympathetic accounts. An example is the map of a "disappearing Palestine" that millions have reposted, a blatantly misleading map meant to depict "Zionist colonization", meanwhile, neglecting the historical borders of the conflict. There are many other forms of historical negligence that they commonly employ that are extremely damaging for understanding the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, Western leftists are keeping up with the Western traditions of white saviorism and interfering with this particular trendy foreign conflict. I could have written a few more grievances that I have of the Western left(including the embracement of far-right Islamist groups) but I wanted to keep the post relatively short. In several months, Western leftists will forget about the Gazans suffering under the disproportional force of the IDF. Nobody will self-criticize the ideas or tactics that they engaged in, meanwhile, the Israeli left-wing and reliable non-Hamas Palestinian advocacy organizations are left in the dust by an ineffective white-savior-esqe Western movement. Not only that but due to all of these factors making the left look like lunatics, Biden and the Democrats are being affected in the polling, which may result in Trump being elected, a terrible outcome for Palestinians.\n\nIf you want to respond to me, **please avoid strawmanning or whataboutism**. I acknowledge that the state of Israel and Jewish-"advocacy" organizations are partially responsible for worsening the grievances listed above. However, I know from posting on this sub before, that 50% of the comments are going to be either misrepresenting my stated position or trying to "hypocrisy-burn" me.\n\nEDIT 1: I will try to respond to direct questions or direct criticisms. They are welcome.  ', 388, 649)

I am neither "pro Palestine" or "pro Israel"\n\nFor about a week or two, there were rumours and buzzes about an Iran attack that is coming soon. Both on the news, and general panic in Israeli social media. I\'ve dismissed it and convinced myself that their tactic is to scare us thru Iranian bots and that no attack is going to happen. For context, I\'ve never lived during an attack from a force other then Hammas and their made-in-china rockets.\n\nYesterday I was on my way to a friend\'s birthday in central Tel Aviv,  on my way there my friend started texting me saying she is worried because of things she sees on tiktok. I told her to not believe anything she sees there, and there\'s no Iranian attack coming. Not even 15 minutes later the government releases a message that school is cancelled tomorrow (which there was already none of, because of Passover. So it was basically a message saying "some bad-shittery is about to go down tomorrow"). I was starting to stress out but I still went to celebrate the birthday. Around 10pm one of the people in the birthday gets up and whispers in the birthday girl\'s ear "some fireworks are about to go off in an hour" which meant there are rumours that rockets are about to shoot. \n\nWe all decided that if Iran drops an atom bomb and we\'re all gonna die, were at least going to get fucked up tonight and continued drinking and having fun. But everyone started stressing more and more, and one couple decided they rather go home, near a bomb shelter. We wanted to keep the party going so we paid and decided to go to one of the guys house and keep drinking there. Five guys went by car and me and the birthday girl went by bus. Before we even managed to reach the bus station we get a call from the guys (which are also IDF soldiers) all they said was "don\'t come. It\'s going to be a rough night, get some sleep". We got really stressed and decided to go to my house.\n\nOn the bus a ticket guy started checking tickets and an old lady started yelling "we are going to die! And you are worried about tickets?? Shame on you!" Then we got off and got to my house. In my house the news were open on the TV, which is rare in my house, and my mom was packing a big bag in case we will need to stay in the bomb shelter for a long time. We started watching the news, and suddenly, they were off. They said the war planes are on their way to us. They started by saying we have seven hours until they reach. We all sat in silence in front of the news, watched the hours go down. Six hours, five hours, three hours, half an hour. Ten minutes. They said they were sending ballistic rockets too. They started reaching the north, then the south, then everywhere. Admittedly they didn\'t reach Tel Aviv. We stayed up all night watching the iron dome blow up the rockets and the planes.\nJordan, USA, Britain and maybe Iraq also stopped the planes and rockets\n And finally went to sleep for an hour in 5am. Woke up to see the news, Iran said they won\'t attack again if Israel won\'t attack back, but of course our kindergarten of a government will attack back. The next days are not going to be calm, I\'m safe, one Israeli Muslim kid died from the rockets, 32 went to the hospital from aggressive anxiety attacks. Pray for us.', 383, 1067)

Let me also clarify, that I don’t agree with the right wing position on this subject either (basically just the opposite of this, supporting Israel and downplaying their government’s atrocities). But, as a member of multiple leftist communities on this site, I am constantly seeing people fully supporting Palestine with the justification that what Hamas does isn’t as bad as what Israel does. I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence, but what I don’t understand is everyone chanting “Free Palestine” and showing no remorse for the Israeli people that were harmed. About the phrase “Free Palestine”: on a surface level, this phrase is perfectly fine. However, I like to compare this phrase to the phrase “All Lives Matter”. On a surface level, there’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s the stigma and history behind it that makes it offensive to say. With all lives matter, it’s due to it being against the blm movement, and with free Palestine, especially since these horrific events occurred, it’s due to the phrase subtly implying that the actions of Hamas are justifiable, and even more so, completely disregarding the suffering of those in Israel. Now, I really want to give the left the benefit of the doubt that they don’t support Hamas, but it’s starting to get really difficult, with people implying that their actions are for a greater cause. I’m not necessarily saying that they support Hamas, but I really am starting to see a pattern of them never bringing up the horrible things Hamas has done and only hating on Israel; same with the right, they only talk about how horrible Hamas is with no regards to the atrocities of the Israeli government. I’m not saying that it’s a 50/50 necessarily, but neither side is justified in the slightest, and all our support should be aimed towards the innocent people of both sides rather than the oppressors of either side.

My sister is only 20 years old, she went to a party with her boyfriend and they  found themselves in a battlefield. She didn’t mention but I will, In these 6hours of hiding she held her hurt head friend with a towel on his wound and saved his life. When soldiers came to rescue them after six hours and asked them to take bodies from the field she performed CPR on few of them. She recognized her friends among the hundreds of bodies. Now read her documentation (which I translated using ChatGPT)\n\n\n"My heart is shattered.\nYesterday morning, rockets started during the party. We quickly started to pack everything to flee as fast as we could, and then we heard gunshots from both entrances to the party. According to reports, we understood that there were terrorists on every road, and we decided to stay in the area of the party where there was police and  gunshots and our jeep was targeted. We started to flee. We were surrounded by terrorists from all directions, who kept shooting at our car. We piled up on each other in the car and tried to escape in every possible direction. We saw an IDF jeep on a hill and decided to approach it to at least be close to weapons. The jeep was abandoned and bloodied. We managed to grab some weapons found there, which turned out to be jammed, and tried to fix them while escaping. We saw our friends falling one by one to the ground from the gunshots. We managed to escape towards the fields when suddenly a group of 10 terrorists jumped us. If not for the driving skills of my partner, Dor, I don\'t know what would have happened to us. After about an hour of escaping from groups of terrorists and gunshots everywhere, we stopped the car to check the surroundings, understand where the gunshots were coming from, and decide the best escape route. Another group of 8 terrorists on motorcycles approached us. Two friends, Oded and Alex, couldn\'t get back in the car and just ran towards the fields to hide. The group kept chasing us with a barrage of bullets. A friend who sat in the back was shot in the head. Dor performed a drift, knocking down two terrorists on a motorcycle, definitely killing one. As we escaped from this group, another group started chasing us, with us having a gunshot victim in the car. The police didn\'t know where to direct us, and the dispatcher on the line told us to head to Ba\'ari, just to make sure there were our forces at the entrance.

We began to hear shouts in Arabic and by a miracle that only God could have made, I found a toilet that was unlocked. We hid there for about 6 hours. \nWhen we realized we were in a building of a Hamas cell, and they were constantly close to the toilet window and door, there were several military attempts against the terrorists in Ba\'ari. After hearing them shooting and starting to sing in Arabic, we realized we were alone. We kept silent and tried to breathe quietly, spread towels on the floor to avoid any noise of movement, and prayed for our lives. The bathroom door didn\'t have a lock, and Dor had to hold it for 6 hours while staying close to the wall. The door was made of glass so if they tried to open it, they\'d think it was locked. I and the injured person hid behind a curtain, using towels and paper to stop the bleeding and keep him conscious. The building we were in was hit by 7 RPG rockets, 3 missiles, and countless bullet sprays for 6 hours! Everything was destroyed except the small space we were in; only the ceiling and walls fell and crumbled on us. We remained silent, neither when missiles were launched at us nor during the shootings. The main thing was to stay quiet. For 6 hours, the military and all the units knew exactly where we were, but no one came. 6 hours of eternity, we couldn\'t believe we came out of it alive. 2 soldiers arrived from a nearby post, having escaped from terrorists themselves. We helped them carry the wounded and traumatized. The area around us was full of bodies and body parts. We loaded an unconscious but breathing man with gunshot wounds all over his body and decided to head towards the nearest checkpoint. We reached them, handed over the wounded who were taken in an armored vehicle to the hospital. We remained at the checkpoint for another 3 hours, under gunfire because it wasn\'t safe to go on the road, but with armed soldiers and police, it felt safer. It\'s an open miracle that we managed to survive and come out alive; God heard my prayers and cries. \n\nAlthough the army couldn\'t reach us, I\'m deeply grateful. When we reached the first checkpoint and the soldier hugged me, I felt as safe as possible in a battlefield. The road was full of bodies, smoke, and abandoned cars containing bodies and parts of what was once a human being. My body still hurts from all the hits we took while driving and the debris that fell on us in hiding. The emotional pain of seeing our friends killed, countless bodies (I estimate more than 150 people dead that we saw) and several traumatized we tried to help, will never fade.

I have spent the last three years studying the conflict in great detail, devoting an entire year to it at the hebrew university of jerusalem. I've studied under Palestinian Arab, Palestinian Christian, Israeli Jewish, European Jewish, and European Christian professors. I spent the last week and a half nonstop trying to write about this conflict to submit something to my university paper but every time I finish a draft I feel like it both over and under sympathizes with both sides. To put it briefly: I'm torn.\n\nI understand that antisemitism has defined Jewish existence for the past 2000+ years: our expulsion from the Middle East, persecution in Ethiopia, genocide in Germany and pogroms in Russia are only the most recent proof of this. I understand that the only way to secure Jewish protection is through a Jewish majority state with Jewish governance.\n\nBut nothing that I've learned has justified in my mind the occupation of 5 million Palestinians. The daily tortures and miseries they have gone through in the West Bank and Gaza since the 40s is too inhumane for words. And I can't justify the fact that we deny 13 million Palestinians their right of return. After Jews were expelled, 15 distinct empires controlled that area - the Palestinian people are the amalgam of residents left behind, and possess claims to the land nearly as ancient as ours. The idea that us jews have a right of return, but palestinians do not, seems criminal to me, like we're making palestinians pay the price of suffering that had nothing to do with them.\n\nIn my mind a Confederation solution would be ideal, where two independent states are created, their border dissolved into a dotted line and residents allowed to live in either territory. A third, joint government would handle things like security, resources, and the economy. But I feel like the existing hegemony between Israel and Palestine would not be fully dissolved as long as there existed two independent states, and as long as there is a hegemony there will be violence and oppression.\n\nI don't know. I really don't know. I don't want to be considered a liberal brown-noser by my Jewish friends and I don't want my non-jew friends to call me a colonizer. I'm sick of feeling guilty for taking up space on social media to talk about antisemitism when all of this is going on, but I'm also sick of other Jews not talking enough about the crimes Israel is committing. I don't want to feel like I have to defend Israel's colonial practices (even if you don't think it was definitionally colonialism because we too are indigenous, our forced displacement of more than 1 million indigenous palestinians was objectively experienced as colonialism).\n\nI don't know what to make of claims that Arabs and Jews simply can't live together. It seems so vile to assume that every Palestinian is a terrorist. And it seems so reductive and racist to believe that Palestinians are merely another extension of the 'Arab Kingdom'. But our ancestors were objectively all kicked out of every Arab country within the last half century. the last of yemen's jews were literally exiled last week. it doesn't feel like it's my place to tell the children of these refugees that arabs are all good and fine to live with. but it also seems like the region will never have peace if we don't coexist in a confederation-like or secular democratic state, and israel's war crimes will only increase.\n\nI'm just, I hate this. I live in a house of leftist athiests, there's not a lot of room for sympathy for religious ethnostates that actively oppress an indigenous population. Does anyone else feel this way????? What happens now??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: to those in the comments claiming that palestinians are not a people, or that I  have merely been victim to propaganda, that i'm uneducated: please stop. my hope with this post was to have civil discussions about solutions and to find other openminded people.

It’s actually disgraceful. It’s an insult to the many genocides that have actually occurred in the last 50 years that no one cares about or even knows of.\n\nLet me explain why the genocide claims are not true.\n\n- Israel has no stated intention of committing genocide. The genocidal statements of some Israeli governments officials and representatives are not evidence of stated intention. They’re just a few peoples edgy opinions that are not carried out in a tangible way.\n\n- Approximately 60,000 Palestinians have died since 1948, and most of the deaths have been during war periods. This averages out to about 800 per year. For reference, the Nazis killed about 1.5 million Jews per year between 1941 and 1945.\n\n- The Palestinian population has gone up 4x since 1948. And the Gazan population has doubled since 2000.\n\n- Israel have Gaza back in 2005. If they were hell bent on genocide, why would they do that.\n\n- Israel supplies Gaza with free water and electricity (until recently). A very strange thing to do if you are wanting to commit genocide.\n\n- Israel provides Palestinians with jobs and income. Another peculiar thing to do if one’s intent is to commit genocide.\n\n- Israel has tried to offer the Palestinians their own state that they can have autonomy over. A very very ridiculous thing to do if you wanted to eradicate a nation or group of people.\n\n- Israel provides humanitarian aid to Gazans. Furthermore, Israel built and funded a lot of the infrastructure in Gaza in the 80s and 90s to prop it up and promote health services. Weird for a genocidal country to do that.\n\n- Death toll =/= genocide. Yes, understanding 10,000 plus Gazans have died, is not evidence of genocide. You must understand why and how they have died. Did America commit genocide against the Japanese, Iraqis, Afghans and Germans? Did England commit genocide against the Germans, Turks and Italians? No of course not. They were fighting and the unfortunate result was loss of civilians life. That is not evidence of genocide.\n\nYes, I’m sure you can point to a few people in the Israeli government who have said some not so smart things about solving the Palestine issue. And you can also point to bad apples in the IDF who have acted out of line and been disciplined for it. However, this is not evidence of genocide. You actually have to commit genocide to be accused of genocide. I’m also referring to Raz Segal, Owen Jones and Norman Finkelstein. Their claims are ridiculous, especially coming from University professors and I urge them to look at the many other genocides that have actually occurred and study those to understand what an actual genocide looks like.', 354, 2117)

It was sent to “decision-makers” in the United Nations to leave “no room for denial or disregard.\n\n“The terrorist organization Hamas chose to harm Israel strategically in two clear ways – kidnapping citizens and committing sadistic sexual crimes,” said ARCCI CEO Orit Sulitzeanu. “Silence will be remembered as a historical stain on those who chose to remain silent and deny the sexual crimes committed by Hamas.”\n\nThe report revealed that Hamas terrorists threatened victims, often injured women, with weapons in order to rape them violently, often collectively with collaboration between multiple terrorists.\n\nPartners, family, and friends were forced to watch to “increase the pain and humiliation for all present.”\n\nMost of those sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists were killed afterward, and some even during the act of rape. Others still were found dead later, their genitals mutilated beyond recognition or penetrated with weapons.\n\n**The full extent of Hamas\'s sexual crimes will probably never be known**\n\nThe report highlighted that it cannot provide the full numerical measure of the extent of Hamas’s sexual violence, “most of which resulted in the victims\' deaths, making their full extent unknown and possibly unknowable.”\n\nThe sexual assaults occurred in four main locations: At the Nova Festival, in kibbutzim, on IDF bases, and in captivity.\n\nSevere sexual assaults were reported on multiple occasions by eye-witnesses and first responders in the Nova Festival, including group rapes. On kibbutzim, women and girls alike were brutally assaulted, including at least one case of a knife being hidden in the genital organ of one such victim.\n\nSoldiers on IDF bases were victims of sexual violence, as well, their bodies clearly indicated. Hostages who have returned from Gaza have revealed grotesque sexual violence towards the hostages, as well.\n\n“As the scars in our hearts refuse to heal, and the souls of our sisters and brothers cry out to us from the depths of the earth, a significant portion of those we considered partners responded in silence and denial of these horrors,” the report’s authors, Dr. Carmit Klar-Chalamish and Noga Berger, wrote. “We call on you to raise your voices and not allow the cries of these victims to fade away.”\n\nhttps://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-787994\n\n______________________\n\nAs more and more evidence about Hamas\'s atrocious sexual violence comes to light, the silence of the UN, women\'s organizations and the entire people who call themselves "Pro-Palestinians" is becoming extremely loud.\n\nWhat has happened in October 7 would not be tolerated by any people, any country, and Israel is obligated to make sure the Palestinians in Gaza do not have the ability to do something such as this ever again.\n\nIt is a huge tragedy yet amusing at the same time watching the "Anti-Zionist" crowd denying this, exactly like past generations denied or reduced past atrocities done to Jews, and even launch "Counter" investigations based on no evidence at all trying their absolute best to create some equivalency between raping terrorists and the IDF.

Even worse is that very often the standard by which our equality is judged is of itself testament to that inequality, i.e. being compared to Muslims in foreign lands instead of Jewish citizens of the same country. Meanwhile, issues that would spark unstoppable outrage in the western world have long taken a backseat to more pressing issues of crime and poverty. We have simply learned to *accept* them as reality, but they are nonetheless unforgotten and serve as a constant reminder to our inequality. One of the main issues that contributed to the formation of our identity and that understandably results in significant portions of our community identifying more strongly with the Palestinian people is the question of land.\n\nI will use my own family as an example. My family on both my father's and mother's side (all citizens) owns land in the north located in what later became a small Jewish community settlement. We have long given up trying to get permission to build on this land or to at least have it swapped for another land by the Israel Land Authority. Meanwhile, (literally) adjacent to this land from multiple directions you will find Jewish residences. It just so happens that the Arab owned land in this area is not designated for building. To even physically access our own land is a major hassle that requires coordination with the settlement days upfront. And what about getting approved by the responsible board as members of an exclusively Jewish settlement? We have better chances at winning the lottery.\n\nThe only thing left for us to do would be to sell the land to the settlement.
