('https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelWarVideoReport/comments/1741x92/im_israeli_the_bloodthirstiness_in_this_subreddit/', "I'm Israeli. The bloodthirstiness in this subreddit is disturbing.", 'Hear me out.\n\nTwo days ago, I woke up to a phonecall. I\'m a dog boarder, and it was a client. It was saturday morning, and I was surprised to hear from him, but he said he\'d been called up for reserve duty and needed to board his dog with me immediately. I said of course. This was my first hint that something unusual was going on.\n\nI opened up my phone and checked the news. Since then, I\'ve been glued to my phone. I\'ve seen all the videos you\'ve seen. I\'ve watched the videos of confused children being poked and prodded and told "say mother again! say it!" I\'ve seen the videos of rooms full of dead bodies, pools of blood, and terrorists shooting the dead bodies. I\'ve seen the video of the terrorist with the garden hoe attempting to decapitate a still living, gut-shot foreign agricultural worker, who was just a refugee looking for a better life. I\'ve seen the mothers sobbing. I\'ve seen the piles of bodies. I\'ve seen the terrified 18 year olds being dragged away on motorcycles. I\'ve seen terrorists kicking restrained hostages, screaming curses at them. I\'ve seen people in the streets of gaza celebrating the slaughter.\n\nI\'ve seen it all. The daughter of a family friend was taken with her two children, aged 4 and 1.5, while her husband heard it happen over the phone. The two children were later found, abandoned but alive, on the gaza border. The mother hasn\'t been seen since.\n\nMy heart aches, and I am as angry as I\'ve ever been. I want these fuckers to pay. I want the Hamas terrorists to be removed from this earth.\n\nBut yeah, like the title said, the bloodthirstiness I\'ve been seeing in the comments disturbs me. I\'ve seen commenters hoping that the 2.3 MILLION people in gaza get exterminated, because "they voted for Hamas". Never mind that the election was in 2006, and since then there hasn\'t been an election. And never mind that 47% of Gazans are children, all of which could not have voted in 2006, and most of which weren\'t even alive (or if they were, were in diapers). So, these children, many of which I\'m sure are currently hoping I die a terrible death, have never known anything but the shit-show that is Hamas run Gaza.\n\nMillions of people. Half of them children. And commenters on this sub are hoping many of them die. That\'s fucked up. Most people in gaza have as little to do with what\'s happened to my family friend\'s daughter as I do, and they should pay for the terrible war crimes commited by Hamas? Keep in mind that if you say yes, you are saying the same thing as people who are currently cheering for the 800+ deaths in Israel.\n\nThis war is going to get much, much, much worse. But at the very least, you can be sad that there is going to be more loss of life, more suffering, more pain.\n\nIt\'s trite, but two wrongs don\'t make a right.\n\nI hope Hamas is smashed to bits. I hope the Mossad hunts down every one of their leaders. I hope the fuckers who commited these attrocities are obliterated. But cheering for the deaths and suffering of a civilian population? That\'s fucked up.\n\nIn the room with me right now, I have Django, a Belgian Malinois and regular visitor. His owner/dad is down south right now, fighting. I believe he\'s special forces.\n\nI also have Louis, a BBB (Big Brown Boy). His owners live up north, right by the border with Lebanon. They evacuated yesterday.\n\nAnd today I had Chica arrive, about 3 hours ago. Her owners live down south, right by Gaza. They\'ve been in their home nonstop, nearly 24/7 since this started. They were just allowed to leave their homes at 5pm today. The wife and all the children are staying in Jerusalem right now. The father is head of security in their town, and has stayed behind, and will for the duration. Chica, who spent all that time cooped up with her terrified owners, is stressed out. She\'s crying right now, and I need to go sit with her. Her owners are scared too. They\'re scared for their father/husband. They don\'t know what happened to their friends from nearby towns that they can\'t get in touch with (thankfully their town didn\'t get hit hard and had no incursions).\n\nThey don\'t deserve to be scared. They didn\'t do anything to ask for this. My client, Django\'s owner, didn\'t do anything except sign up to protect his country. Louis\'s owners didn\'t do anything except buy a house in a small town that happens to be near Lebanon. I don\'t deserve to be scared either. We had two rocket attacks today. The air raid app on my phone starts alarming, and then I hear the sirens, and drag all the dogs into the shelter. Then I hear explosions in the distance (thankfully). Today one was close enough that I felt the pressure wave in my ear drums. I don\'t deserve this.\n\nBut neither do the vast majority of people in gaza. They\'ve been handed the shittiest lot in life, and they have every right to be angry - with Israel, with Hamas, with life itself. Their lives are terrible, and they see no future. They live in hell. Don\'t be happy that their hell is getting even hotter.\n\nAn eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind.', 510, 253)

This diversion has had a detrimental effect on Gaza's potential to become a thriving coastal city, as infrastructure essential for the well-being of its residents has been neglected.\n\nWhy has Egypt been so reluctant to open their borders? Why? They’re brothers, so how could this be? Because welcoming Palestinians unfortunately means welcoming Hamas. Egypt's reluctance to open its borders to the Palestinian people is attributed to its concerns over Hamas's influence in the region. The presence of Hamas complicates the situation, but it’s a valid concern. The group's association with acts of violence and terrorism creates a reluctance to welcome Palestinians, despite the underlying desire to support their fellow Arabs.\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge the sufferings of the Palestinian people, particularly those living under the rule of Hamas. While it's not fair to hold all Palestinians accountable for the actions of this extremist group, addressing the root cause of the problem—Hamas's terrorism and leadership—is paramount. They voted them into power and gave up their own lives for them as a result. Eliminating Hamas's presence should be the initial step toward lasting peace and stability in the region. \n\nOver the years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seen numerous opportunities for peace and resolution, with individuals like Ariel Sharon proposing viable solutions. Great ones, in fact. Unfortunately, these opportunities were all met with resistance, and peace initiatives have been derailed. Let’s look at the 100 years of “NO” from Palestinian leadership:\n\n1919: Arabs of Palestine refused to nominate representatives to the Paris Peace Conference.\n\n1920: San Remo conference decisions, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.\n\n1922: League of Nations decisions, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.\n\n1937: Peel Commission partition proposal, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.\n\n1938: Woodhead partition proposal, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.\n\n1946: Anglo-American Commission proposal, rejected by the Arabs of Palestine.\n\n1947: UN General Assembly partition proposal (UNGAR 181), rejected by the Arab League and the Higher Arab Committee for Palestine/.\n\n1949: Israel's outstretched hand for peace (UNGAR 194), rejected by the Arab League and the Higher Arab committee for Palestine.\n\n1967: Israel's outstretched hand for peace (UNSCR 242), rejected by the Arab League and the PLO.\n\n1978: Begin/Sa’adat peace proposal, rejected (except for Egypt) by the rest of the Arab world, including the PLO.\n\n1994: Rabin/Hussein peace agreement, rejected by the rest of the Arab League (except for Egypt and Jordan).\n\n1995: Rabin's Contour-for-Peace, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n2000: Barak/Clinton peace offer, rejected by Yasser Arafat, who then initiated the pre-planned second intifada.\n\n2001: Barak’s offer at Taba, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n2005: Sharon's peace gesture, withdrawal from Gaza, rejected by the Hamas takeover in 2007.\n\n2008: Olmert/Bush peace offer, rejected by Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n2009 to present: Netanyahu's repeated invitations to peace talks, rejected.\n\n2014: Kerry's Contour-for-Peace, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n2018: Trump’s “deal of the Century”, rejected in advance by Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n2019: US Conference on Economic Benefit for the Palestinians, rejected by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n2020: PA reiterates rejection of Trump’s “Deal of the Century” before it’s even presented.\n\n2020: Palestinian rejection of the normalization agreement between the UAE and Israel.\n\n2020: Palestinian objections to Serbia and Kosovo moving their embassies from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nAre no Palestinian supporters sickened by Hamas’s tactic in hiding in tunnels, using their own people as collateral despite knowing that they (Hamas) are Israel’s target? Hamas stayed with the innocent residents of Palestine on purpose! \n\nSo, my question is simple: \n\nWhat was the purpose of the Oct 7 attacks? Can any Pro-Palestine person tell me what exactly was accomplished? What was the point?  It did absolutely NOTHING except kill thousands on both sides. \n\nWhat did they think would happen after an attack like that? What should Israel have done? Nothing?

The difference between Islam and all the other religions of the world is vastly different, they practice peace, Christianity is one of the most peaceful religions out there.  Now before all the lunatics start talking about 200 years ago or even longer, the world was a very different place even just 50 years ago let alone 200 or more.  I have no idea how to fix Islam, I don’t think you can.  What pisses me off the most is that no western government has asked its citizens what they want.
