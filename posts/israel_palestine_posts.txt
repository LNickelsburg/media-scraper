Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, refrained from ordering a Metzah probe. The main reason for this is that there is no suspicion of a criminal act: The soldiers testified that they did not see the journalist at all and aimed their fire at gunmen, who were indeed nearby. **However, it seems that one of the reasons for the decision was the belief that such an investigation, which would necessitate questioning as potential criminal suspects soldiers for their actions during a military operation, would provoke opposition and controversy within the IDF and in Israeli society in general.**\n\n>The Israeli right, in particular, has in recent years sharply criticized every case in which an investigation is opened against fighters. The decision not to open a criminal investigation, for which no official announcement has been made, is likely to provoke criticism from Washington, which has demanded that Israel investigate Abu Akleh’s death fully.\n\n* [Haaretz - Israeli Military Will Not Conduct Criminal Probe Into Al Jazeera Reporter’s Death](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-military-will-not-conduct-criminal-probe-into-al-jazeera-reporter-s-death-1.10808866)\n\n#**[6]** The investigations. \n\nIn addition to *The Washington Post*, there have now been 3 other investigations about the killing of Abu Akleh.\n\n\n* [**CNN** - \'They were shooting directly at the journalists\': New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted attack by Israeli forces](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/middleeast/shireen-abu-akleh-jenin-killing-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html)\n\n* [**The Associated Press** - Review suggests Israeli fire killed reporter, no final word](https://apnews.com/article/politics-west-bank-middle-east-israel-8df6c999627efcef2fe0ca2b401e7a2c)\n\n* [**BellingCat** - Unravelling the Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2022/05/14/unravelling-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh/)\n\nAll investigations have come to the conclusion that an Israeli soldier likely killed Abu Akleh.\n\nJust to summarize the CNN investigation (since that\'s the one I\'m familiar with), here are the key points:\n\n**[1]** Audio analysis of the gunfire establishes a distance of 177 to 197 meters away. \n\n* An adjacent tree, where Abu Akleh died nearby, bears the marks of the gunfire. CNN cites an expert who believes the tight-grouping of the shots imply intention/skill.\n\n**[2]** One IDF armored vehicle is seen 3 min. prior to Shireen\'s killing, at about the same distance away AND in the same direction as the gunfire.\n\n* Multiple videos from different angles are shown.\n\n* Witnesses claim they were shot at from IDF in this direction.\n\n**[3]** No Palestinian forces within relevant range.\n\n* Palestinian forces were either further back and/or off to the side, out of line-of-sight of Abu Akleh.\n\nThe other investigations come to similar conclusions - including the WaPo report, which I skimmed. Important to note that they all establish that the IDF were closest to Shireen and the shot was fired from roughly 200 meters away, which happens to be where an IDF convoy was spotted prior to her killing.\n\n---\n\n#**[Conclusions]**\n\nThe purpose of this post was to provide historical background & context to explain why critics are skeptical of the Israeli government\'s narratives & of the usual accompanying hasbara. \n\nIn the past, the Israeli government has lied about other human rights abuses. For example:\n\n* [The Israeli government/army lies regarding the Qana massacre.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/uor3oh/very_well_said/i8gka51/)\n\n* [Rabin\'s policy of \'breaking Palestinian protesters\' bones\'. In 1988, Israeli General Amnon Straschnow denied there was any policy to systematically abuse Palestinians. We now know this was EXACTLY the case. Then-Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the IDF to \'break the bones\' of Palestinian protesters.](https://streamable.com/dkefsf)\n\n  * [**Additional.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/obr1a9/feb_26th_1988_a_few_months_into_the_first/)', 82, 129)
