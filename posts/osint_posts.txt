Use [This Person Does Not Exist](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/) to generate an image. Make sure you inspect the image closely and get one that doesn\'t have any obvious flaws, as they often do. It is worth picking up some Photoshop, GIMP, Affinity Photo or Designer, or other basic image manipulation skills to fix them and change the background of the image.\n4. Get a burner phone, completely wiped and fresh. Can be any brand that will accept a Mint Mobile SIM card.\n5. Get a burner credit card from [Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/) to use for on Amazon and possible the Mint Mobile setup. They might need it to set up the account.\n6. Set up a burner Amazon account. We\'re only going to use it once.\n7. Buy two Mint Mobile SIM cards. You can find them various places online and in stores near you, but you can get two of them for $5 on Amazon. They also give you 1 week free trial with something like 100 text messages, which we\'re going to use. This gives you two cards for two sockpuppet accounts for only $5.\n8. I like to use Amazon to have the card sent to an Amazon pickup box, which can be anonymous.\n9. Get a VPN that you can set to the physical area in which you want your sockpuppet to "exist."\n10. Set up the Mint Mobile trial account somewhere away from your home; as far as you\'re willing to go.\n11. Use this Mint Mobile trial phone number to set up all of the websites you need.\n12. I recommend at least set up a Google account and Protonmail account. Both will come in handy at different times.\n13. Once you\'ve set up all the accounts with your trial Mint SIM, set up 2FA on all of the accounts.\n14. After setting up 2FA on all of the accounts, change the phone number to one you have more permanent access to, such as MySudo or Google Voice. \n15. Make sure everything works!\n16. Destroy the SIM card.\n17. Wipe the phone.\n\nA lot of these websites are blocking MySudo, Google Voice, and other VoIP numbers. That\'s why we go through the Mint phone number first.\n\nThey should be less stringent now.\n\nAs always, feedback is welcome!

OSINT is valuable for investigations because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation demands compared to other forms of intelligence, provides a rich variety of perspectives, and can serve as a foundation for comprehending classified material. OSINT can also protect sources and methods in intelligence assessments.\n\n "INTRODUCTION TO OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)\n\nA Brief History: The exact origin of the term OSINT is unclear, but the concept of obtaining intelligence through publicly accessible resources has likely existed for centuries. During World War II, various nations\' security agencies began incorporating OSINT into their intelligence strategies. In recent times, with the rapid expansion of internet communications and the proliferation of digital information generated by the public, OSINT has become an indispensable tool for numerous organizations, including government departments, NGOs, and corporations, who increasingly rely on open-source information as opposed to classified or confidential data. "\n\nOSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence because they must be legally accessible by the public without breaching any copyright or privacy laws. This distinction makes the ability to gather OSINT sources applicable to more than just security services. For example, businesses can benefit from exploiting these resources to gain intelligence about their competitors.\n\n# How is OSINT used by investigators and law enforcement?\n\nOSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is used by investigators and law enforcement to gather information from publicly available sources, such as the internet, media outlets, and social networks. This information can then be analyzed and used to support investigations, to build a profile of individuals or organizations, to gather intelligence about criminal or terrorist activities, or to help track down suspects. Examples of OSINT sources include public databases, social media posts, news articles, satellite imagery, and forums. By leveraging the vast amounts of information available through open sources, investigators and law enforcement can more effectively gather the information they need to perform their duties.\n\n"Utilization of OSINT by Investigators and Law Enforcement: OSINT encompasses a vast array of publicly accessible information sources. This information can be located both online and offline, including but not limited to:\n\n\\-The internet, such as forums, blogs, social media, video-sharing platforms, wikis, Whois records of registered domains, metadata and digital files, resources within the dark web, geolocation data, IP addresses, people search engines, and all other information retrievable online. -Conventional mass media such as television, radio, newspapers, books, and magazines. -Specialized journals, academic publications, dissertations, conference proceedings, company profiles, annual reports, company news, employee profiles, and r√©sum√©s. -Photos, videos, and associated metadata. -Geospatial information, such as maps and commercial imagery products."\n\n# [https://www.secjuice.com/introduction-to-open-source-intelligence-osint/](https://www.secjuice.com/introduction-to-open-source-intelligence-osint/)\n\nOpen-source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, (Intel community) the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. A notable example relates to terrorism, where open-source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.\n\nOpen-source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open-source reporting. This can prove useful when policy-makers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.\n\n"Value of OSINT: OSINT is prized for its reduced processing and exploitation demands compared to more technical intelligence disciplines like HUMINT, SIGINT, MASINT, and GEOINT. Additionally, the vast array of sources covered by OSINT provides a rich array of perspectives.\n\nSupplementing Classified Information: Open-source information serves as a foundation for comprehending classified material. Despite the abundance of classified information produced by the Intelligence Community, the quantity of classified information available for a specific topic may be limited and can lack context if only viewed through a classified lens. For instance, in the realm of terrorism, OSINT can bridge gaps and create connections to enhance analysts\' understanding of fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist schemes, possible attack modes, and potential targets.\n\nProtection of Sources and Methods: In some cases, an intelligence assessment informed by sensitive, classified information can be justified on the basis of open-source reporting. This can be advantageous when policymakers must explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources."\n\nOSINT (Open Source Intelligence) refers to the gathering and analysis of information obtained from publicly accessible sources, including online and offline sources such as the Internet, traditional media, academic publications, photos and videos, geospatial information, and more. OSINT is valuable for investigations because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation demands compared to other forms of intelligence, provides a rich variety of perspectives, and can serve as a foundation for comprehending classified material. OSINT can also protect sources and methods in intelligence assessments.\n\n# Phases of the OSINT Process;\n\nRefined OSINT Information Gathering Process\n\nOSINT is a crucial aspect of the Reconnaissance phase of hacking and the collected information is carried forward into the Enumeration phase. With the immense amount of data available on the web, it is essential for attackers to have a structured search framework and an array of OSINT collection tools to aid in the task and avoid being overwhelmed by the information present on the internet.\n\nThe OSINT reconnaissance process can be further divided into the following five sub-phases:\n\nSource Identification: As the first step, the attacker identifies potential sources from which information can be collected. These sources are documented in detailed notes for future reference, if required.\n\nData Harvesting: In this phase, the attacker collects and harvests information from the selected sources and any other sources that are discovered during this phase.\n\nData Processing and Integration: In this phase, the attacker processes the harvested information to gather actionable intelligence by searching for relevant information that may aid in the investigation.\n\nData Analysis: In this phase, the attacker analyzes the processed information using OSINT analysis tools.\n\nResults Delivery: In the final phase, the OSINT analysis is complete and the findings are presented or reported to the members of the Red Team.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nhope this helps :)', 137, 6)

From fighting back at scammers, to finding missing people, to helping victims of phishing. I should clarify, that a lot of this is going to come off as hard to believe. And while I have receipts for a lot of it, I can't show them, a lot of the people I've worked with are huge on privacy (of course) and don't want their information shared. So I'll provide receipts and evidence when I can.   \n\nStage 1. - The Noob  \nI first started learning about OSINT just before my first year of college, but I didn't know it was called OSINT at the time. I had seen examples of OSINT from YouTube videos made by people like Jim Browning and Scambaiter, but I didn't know how any of it worked. As I started my first year of college, I learned about Tracelabs from a story on YouTube. After I learned about TraceLabs, I decided to get involved and learn how to do this. So I went on their website, joined a few boards, and started learning all the tools that people used, and learned a good investigative approach. I learned how I could take a single data point, like a username or email, and run it through different looks like Ghunt, Maigret, Dehashed, etc to gain troves of information about an individual. I learned about different image and facial recognition tools, from as basic as Google Images, to Pimeyes, to doing it myself with basic AI facial recognition software. It was an incredibly enlightening experience. I learned from a lot of really smart people, but I never really made a name for myself in this community, as I wasn't interested in the gamified portion of it, I was just interested in helping people. So not being able to see if my work was actually resulting in missing people being found, was incredibly discouraging and eventually, I moved on.  \n\n\nStage 2. - Branching Out and Making Friends  \nSo like I said before, I had seen videos from YouTubers like Jim Browing and Scambaiter, and I knew that I could actually help them using my newly gained skills. So, I decided to try to get in contact with Scambaiter, because he was less popular at the time, and I thought I had a better chance of working with him than Jim Browning.   \n\n\nOf course just to get in contact with him, I needed to prove I was worth his time, so I found the real-life details of a member of his behind-the-scenes team, to prove that my OSINT skills could be useful in finding scammers who had good OpSEC. During this process, I learned that Scambaiter, just like Jim Browning, has an entire group of amateur hackers, security professionals, and researchers like myself who help them behind the scenes. Nobody really knows about this, because it's not apparent in the videos. But there are a ton of people who do a lot of heavy lifting for YouTubers like Scambaiter and Jim Browning. This isn't to diminish what these YouTubers do, it's just to say that sometimes I wish the people behind the scenes got credit too. Regardless, it was an incredible experience, I met a lot of really really smart and talented people, who I am still friends with to this day.\n\nI did end up moving away from the scambaiting community though, mostly because of a lot of scandals that happened behind the scenes. Unfortunately, most of them never ended up getting exposed to the public. Things like people stealing gift cards from victims, and generally just being super-shady and awful. Either way, I learned a lot and made lifelong friends. Those friends have become huge supports for me and many are doing amazing things now! I wish I could say more, but I'm going to respect their privacy.  \n\n\nStage 3. - Going out on my own  \nAfter these two experiences, I ended up helping a family member after their Facebook account had been hacked. This ultimately led to my research into a phishing scam, which led to me exposing a cybercrime gang responsible for stealing what I believe to be millions of Facebook accounts over the past decade or so. I then sold this story to Cybernews, who's published it and I am currently working with some translators to help me communicate with the Dominican Republic CERT team and police, to actually bring justice to the victims.  \n\n\nFinally, I'd just like to say, that the internet is full of awful people, who for far too long have hidden behind their monitors and gotten away with so much. And for a long time, there was nothing anyone could do, but now with the power of OSINT, we can finally unmask these awful people and bring justice to their victims. So if you want to be a part of that, I'd really suggest learning OSINT, it's not going to change your life, but it could change somebody else's.\n\nEDIT: Update, I was hired by a PI firm after posting this, this journey isn't over yet.\n\nReceipts and Evidence:\n\nCyberNews Article: [https://cybernews.com/security/exposed-the-threat-actors-who-are-poisoning-facebook/](https://cybernews.com/security/exposed-the-threat-actors-who-are-poisoning-facebook/)\n\nRedacted photo of research for that article: [https://imgur.com/M7llCS4](https://imgur.com/M7llCS4)", 127, 16)

So I am turning to you all for challenges.\n\n> What kinds of OSINT programs can I build for this community?\n\nGive me your best shot.

It\'s worth checking out IMO.\n\nAnd here is [a quick video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/6phQE0MY_ak) of what this application can now do.\n\nThis is [what the app looks like now](https://hosting.photobucket.com/images/i/bernhoftbret/geospy-web-app-screenshot.png). (*roughly twelve hours after the above links in edit two were shared*)\n\n**Edit Three:**\n\nThis is exciting. From the comments, I can see a number of good opportunities for developing something awesome. I\'m thinking that I would like to collaborate with another, already ongoing OSINT project/resource. Thank you for your encouragement. FOSS is the way to go; generally speaking.\n\n"*If everyone\'s digging for gold, sell shovels.*"\n\n**Edit Four:**\n\nThe next stage of maturity for these projects is to start hosting them, and making the services available to the world. More on that to come soon.\n\n**Edit Five:**\n\nHere is [an underutilized tool](https://github.com/devbret/detailed-audio-analysis) that I developed for analyzing, visualizing and comparing different metrics with and among as many .MP3 and .WAV files as you can process and stand to look at.\n\nYou might be surprised what sound looks like, as measured and displayed over time.\n\n**Edit Six:**\n\nHere\'s [another set of tools](https://github.com/devbret/pihole-data-measurement-tools) that I have developed, for analyzing and visualizing data from your own Pi-hole DNS logs.\n\nI seriously have like two or three dozen prod-ready programs that OSINT folks would likely find helpful.

Which is really just OPSEC. So many benefits to running your own name through the same tools that you would someone or something else.', 108, 34)

Last week I posted on here about an app I built to find tweets based on location ([birdhunt.co](https://birdhunt.co/)). **I wanted to thank you all for the support and the feedback** I have been getting. I have added a lot of features to it recently and want to continue to develop it!\n\nThis weekend I started a new project to try and replicate [birdhunt.co](https://birdhunt.co/) but with Instagram. It\'s a little trickier than I initially thought but I hope it\'s useful to some of you guys.\n\n**The new tool is** [**instahunt.co**](https://instahunt.co/)\n\nIt gives you the ability to map Instagram "places" and find posts near your selected location.\n\nDue to it being a little bit more complex it\'s **desktop only** for the time being. I would love to make this mobile-friendly in the future though. **It also requires an Instagram account** to use.\n\nThe actual tool is more complex so I would love your feedback on how you find using it. Additionally, I would love to hear about any features/ideas you have about what to add next!', 110, 13)
